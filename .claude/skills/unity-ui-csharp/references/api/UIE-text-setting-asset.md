# UITK Text Settings assets

UI Toolkit stores project-wide text settings in the UITK Text Settings asset. UI Toolkit uses a default UITK Text Settings asset for your text objects.

For runtime UI, you can create and assign a UITK Text Settings asset to the Panel Setting asset, and edit the text setting properties:

- To create a UITK Text Settings, select **Assets** > **Create** > **UI Toolkit** > **Text Settings**. This creates a UITK Text Settings asset with the default values.
- To assign a UITK Text Settings to a Panel Setting, select the Panel Setting and drag the UITK Text Settings to the Text Settings field in the **Inspector** window.

**Note**: In the current release, you can’t change the default UITK Text Settings for Editor UI.

This section describes all the properties for the UITK Text Settings asset. The UITK Text Settings asset controls the default values for all text objects used within that Panel.

You can edit the paths to store the font assets, **sprite** assets, custom style sheets, and the color gradient presets. The paths must be a sub-folder of a `Resources` folder. Create a `Resources` folder if you don’t have one in your project.

## Default Font Asset

After you create a font asset from a font file, you must place it in the path set to store all the font assets.

| **Property** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Default Font Asset** | Default font to use when you create a new text object. |
| **Path** | Path to store all the font assets. |

## Fallback Emoji Text Assets

Manage the global fallback font assets list for this font asset.

## Dynamic Font System Settings

Project-wide settings to handle missing glyphs.

| **Disable Warnings** | Enable this if you don’t want to log a warning for every missing glyph. |

## Default Sprite Asset

After you create a sprit asset, you must place it in the path set to store all the sprite assets. You can set a default sprite asset and reference the sprites in the default sprite asset by index or sprite name.

| **Default Sprite Asset** | Sprite asset to use by default. |
| **Missing Sprite Unicode** | Unicode of the sprite for a missing sprite. |

| **Sprite Asset Fallback List** | Add or remove a sprite asset in the fallback list. You can also drag the handles on the left side of any sprit asset to reorder the list. |
