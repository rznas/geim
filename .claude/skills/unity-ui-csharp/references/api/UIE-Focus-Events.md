# Focus events

Focus events occur when an element gains or loses focus.

Focus events are useful when you need to change focus to and away from **visual elements**. Controls often use focus events to change their contents, depending on the focus state. For example, a text field can display placeholder text while it isn’t in focus, or it can react to the `FocusInEvent` to clear the placeholder text.

Focus can change on a visual element from user interactions, such as tabbing or clicking, or using C# **scripts** with `element.Focus()`.

Focus events separate into two distinct types:

- `FocusOutEvent` and `FocusInEvent` are sent along the propagation path just before a focus change occurs.
- `FocusEvent` and `BlurEvent` are sent to the event target, immediately after the change in focus.

The base class for all focus events is FocusEventBase.

The following table describes the focus events and their propagation phases:

| **Event** | **Description** | **Trickles down** | **Bubbles up** | **Cancellable** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FocusOutEvent | Sent before an element loses focus. | **Yes** | **Yes** | **No** |
| FocusInEvent | Sent before an element gains focus. | **Yes** | **Yes** | **No** |
| BlurEvent | Sent after an element has lost focus. | **Yes** | **No** | **No** |
| FocusEvent | Sent after an element has gained focus. | **Yes** | **No** | **No** |

## Unique properties

The following section explains relevant properties unique to focus events. This isn’t a complete list of all properties within the focus event family. For a full list, refer to FocusEventBase.

**`relatedTarget`**: Contains the visual element that’s the secondary target of an event. For `FocusOut` and `Blur` events, it contains the element that gains focus. For `FocusIn` and `Focus` events, it contains the element that loses focus.

| **Event** | **target** | **relatedTarget** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Blur | The element that loses focus. | The element that gains focus. |
| Focus | The element that gains focus. | The element that loses focus. |
| focusIn | The element that gains focus. | The element that loses focus. |
| focusOut | The element that loses focus. | The element that gains focus. |

## Event list

### FocusOutEvent

The `FocusOutEvent` is sent when an element is about to lose focus.

**`target`**: The element that will lose focus.

**`relatedTarget`**: The element that will gain focus.

### FocusInEvent

The `FocusInEvent` is sent when an element is about to gain focus.

**`target`**: The element that will gain focus.

**`relatedTarget`**: The element that will lose focus.

### BlurEvent

The `BlurEvent` is sent after an element lost focus.

**`target`**: The element that lost focus.

**`relatedTarget`**: The element that gained focus.

### FocusEvent

The `FocusEvent` is sent after an element gained focus.

**`target`**: The element that gained focus.

**`relatedTarget`**: The element that lost focus.

## Examples

The following example shows how to use placeholder text in a text field. When the text field is in focus, `FocusInEvent` fires and clears the placeholder text. `FocusOutEvent` toggles the placeholder mode based on the text field contents.

```csharp
using UnityEditor;
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.UIElements;

public class PlaceHolderExample : EditorWindow
{
    [MenuItem("Window/UI Toolkit/PlaceHolderExample")]
    public static void ShowExample()
    {
        PlaceHolderExample wnd = GetWindow<PlaceHolderExample>();
        wnd.titleContent = new GUIContent("PlaceHolderExample");
    }

    // Tracks whether the placeholder text is currently shown.
    private bool placeHolderMode = true;
    // The placeholder text to display when the field is empty.
    private const string placeHolderText = "Write here";

    public void CreateGUI()
    {
        // Create a new TextField and set its value to the placeholder text.
        TextField textField = new TextField();
        textField.value = placeHolderText;
        rootVisualElement.Add(textField);

        // Register callbacks for focus in and out events to manage placeholder behavior.
        textField.RegisterCallback<FocusInEvent>(OnFocusInTextField);
        textField.RegisterCallback<FocusOutEvent>(OnFocusOutTextField);
    }

    // Called when the TextField receives focus.
    private void OnFocusInTextField(FocusInEvent evt)
    {
        // If the placeholder is active, clear the text so the user can start typing.
        if (placeHolderMode)
        {
            var textField = evt.target as TextField;
            if (textField != null)
            {
                textField.value = "";
            }
        }
    }

    // Called when the TextField loses focus.
    private void OnFocusOutTextField(FocusOutEvent evt)
    {
        // If the field is empty after losing focus, restore the placeholder text.
        var textField = evt.currentTarget as TextField;
        if (textField != null)
        {
            placeHolderMode = string.IsNullOrEmpty(textField.value);
            if (placeHolderMode)
                textField.value = placeHolderText;
        }
    }
}
```
