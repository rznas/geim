# Optimize font files with font subsetting

Font subsetting is the process of reducing a font file’s size by including only the specific characters or glyphs needed. This was previously handled through static font asset. However, since font files are now required by the Advanced Text Generator, static font assets are no longer supported.

To subset fonts, use external tools, such as the command-line [FontTools](https://fonttools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library.

## Prerequisites

1. Install Python 3.x.
2. Install FontTools library via pip: `pip install fonttools`.

## Subset fonts with pyftsubset

pyftsubset is a command-line tool included in the [FontTools](https://github.com/fonttools/fonttools) library, used for font subsetting. It allows you to create a smaller font file by including only the specific characters or glyphs you need, which helps reduce file size and improve performance.

Assume you have an example font file named `example.ttf`. The following examples show how to use pyftsubset to subset the font file by Unicode ranges, text, or glyphs.

### Subset by Unicode range

To subset for Basic Latin and Latin–1 Supplement, use the following command:

`pyftsubset example.ttf --unicodes=U+0000-007F,U+00A0-00FF --output-file=subsetted.ttf`

### Subset by text

To subset font files by text, use the following command:

`pyftsubset example.ttf --text="Hello, World! test" --output-file=subsetted.ttf`

### Subset by glyph names

To subset by glyph names, use the following command:

`pyftsubset example.ttf --glyphs=A,B,C --output-file=subsetted.ttf`

### Retain OpenType layout features

By default, subsetting might remove some OpenType layout features, such as kerning or ligatures. You can use the `--layout-features` option to specify the features you want to keep. For example `--layout-features='kern,liga'`. To retain all features, use: `--layout-features=*`
