# USS common properties

This page introduces the common USS properties, their syntax and accepted values, and differences from CSS. For a complete list of USS properties, refer to USS properties reference.

## All

The `all` property resets all properties to their default value. This property doesn’t apply to the custom USS properties.

```
all: initial
```

## Box model

### Dimensions

```
width: <length> | auto
height: <length> | auto
min-width: <length> | auto
min-height: <length> | auto
max-width: <length> | none
max-height: <length> | none
aspect-ratio: <ratio> | auto
```

The `width` and `height` specify the size of the element. If `width` isn’t specified, the width is based on the width of the element’s contents. If `height` isn’t specified, the height is based on the height of the element’s contents.

Aspect ratio is the ratio of the element’s width to its height. You can specify the **aspect ratio** as a floating-point number (for example, `1.777778` for `16/9`) or set it to `auto` to maintain the original aspect ratio.

When you set other sizing properties on an element, such as `width`, `height`, `min-width`, or `max-height`, the `aspect-ratio` property works together with these properties. For example, if you set `height: 200px` on an image and apply an aspect ratio of `3/4`, the image’s width becomes `150px` to maintain the ratio. If you explicitly set both `width` and `height`, those values override the aspect ratio.

To ensure your element maintains the ratio regardless of the content inside, you can set `overflow` to `hidden`.

**Note**: Elements sized using aspect ratio might appear differently on mobile portrait device sizes because the device screen width might not match the ratio’s proportional height. The recommended best practice is to adjust the ratio values or other sizing settings on breakpoints to achieve the desired layout. For example, set a widescreen aspect ratio on an image for larger breakpoints and a square aspect ratio on the same image for mobile breakpoints.

Aspect ratio is equivalent to the `aspect-ratio` CSS property. For more information, refer to [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/aspect-ratio).

### Margins

```
margin-left: <length> | auto;
margin-top: <length> | auto
margin-right: <length> | auto
margin-bottom: <length> | auto
/* Shorthand */
margin: [<length> | auto]{1,4}
```

### Borders

```
border-left-width: <length>
border-top-width: <length>
border-right-width: <length>
border-bottom-width: <length>
/* Shorthand */
border-width: <length>{1,4}
```

### Padding

```
padding-left: <length>
padding-top: <length>
padding-right: <length>
padding-bottom: <length>
/* Shorthand */
padding: <length>{1,4}
```

### Differences from CSS

The alternative box model that USS uses is different from the [standard CSS box model](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model#What_is_the_CSS_box_model). In the standard CSS box model, `width` and `height` define the size of the content box. An element’s rendered size is the sum of its `padding`, `border-width`, and `width` / `height` values.

Unity’s model is equivalent to setting the CSS `box-sizing` property to `border-box`. Refer to the [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-sizing) for details.

## Flex layout

UI Toolkit includes a layout engine that positions **visual elements** based on layout and styling properties. The layout engine implements a subset of Flexbox, an HTML/CSS layout system.

By default, all items are vertically placed in their container.

```
/* Items */
flex-grow: <number>
flex-shrink: <number>
flex-basis: <length> | auto
flex: none | [ <'flex-grow'> <'flex-shrink'>? || <'flex-basis'> ]
align-self: auto | flex-start | flex-end | center | stretch

/* Containers */
flex-direction: row | row-reverse | column | column-reverse
flex-wrap: nowrap | wrap | wrap-reverse
align-content: flex-start | flex-end | center | stretch

/* The default value is `stretch`.
`auto` sets `align-items` to `flex-end`. */
align-items: auto | flex-start | flex-end | center | stretch

justify-content: flex-start | flex-end | center | space-between | space-around
```

## Positioning

```
/* The default value is `relative` which positions the element based on its parent.
If sets to `absolute`, the element leaves its parent layout and values are specified based on the parent bounds.*/
position: absolute | relative

/* The distance from the parent edge or the original position of the element. */
left: <length> | auto
top: <length> | auto
right: <length> | auto
bottom: <length> | auto
```

## Background

```
background-color: <color>
background-image: <resource> | <url> | none
-unity-background-scale-mode: stretch-to-fill | scale-and-crop | scale-to-fit
-unity-background-image-tint-color: <color>
```

For more information about setting background images, refer to Set background images.

## Slicing

When assigning a background image, you draw it with respect to a simplified 9-slice specification:

```
-unity-slice-left: <integer>
-unity-slice-top: <integer>
-unity-slice-right: <integer>
-unity-slice-bottom: <integer>
-unity-slice-scale: <length>
-unity-slice-type: sliced | tiled
```

**Note**: For **sprites**, Unity adjusts the `-unity-slice-scale` by the sprite’s `pixels-per-unit` value in relation to the panel’s `reference sprite pixels per unit value`, which is by default `100`. For example, if the sprite’s `pixels-per-unit` is `16`, the scale is adjusted by `16/100 = 0.16`. Therefore, if you set the scale to `2px`, the final scale is `2px * 0.16px = 0.32px`. For texture and vector images, Unity doesn’t make additional adjustments to the slice scale value you set.

For more information about 9-slice, refer to 9-Slice images with UI Toolkit.

## Border color

```
border-left-color: <color>
border-top-color: <color>
border-right-color: <color>
border-bottom-color: <color>
/* Shorthand */
border-color: <color>{1,4}
```

## Border radius

```
border-top-left-radius: <length>
border-top-right-radius: <length>
border-bottom-left-radius: <length>
border-bottom-right-radius: <length>
/* Shorthand */
border-radius: <length>{1,4}
```

### Differences from CSS

Border radius properties work almost the same in USS and CSS. For detailed information about `border-radius`, refer to the [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-radius).

However, the following are the main differences:

- Unity doesn’t support the second-radius shorthand (`border-radius: (first radius values) / (second radius values);`) used to create elliptical corners.
- Unity reduces border radius values to half of the element’s size in **pixels**. For example, for a 100px x 100px element, any `border-radius` value greater than 50px is reduced to 50px. If you use percentage (`%`) values for border-radius properties, Unity first resolves the percentage to pixels and then reduces the `border-radius` value to half of the resolved pixel value. If you have different radius values for two or more corners, Unity reduces any values greater than half of the element’s size to half of the element’s size.
- If the element’s width and height aren’t equal, or if clamping occurs on one axis, the border radius might be uneven, resulting in elliptical corner rounding.

## Appearance

```
overflow: hidden | visible
-unity-overflow-clip-box: padding-box | content-box
-unity-paragraph-spacing: <length>
visibility: visible | hidden
display: flex | none
```

The `-unity-overflow-clip-box` defines the clipping rectangle for the element content. The default is `padding-box`, the rectangle outside the padding area (the green rectangle in the box model image above); `content-box` represents the value inside the padding area (the blue rectangle in the box model image above).

The `display` default value is `flex`. Set `display` to `none` to remove the element from the UI. Set the `visibility` to `hidden` to hide the element, but the element still occupies space in the layout.

The `overflow` property controls the clipping of an element’s content. The default value is `visible`, which means the element’s content isn’t clipped to the element’s bounds. If you set `overflow` to `hidden`, the element’s content is clipped to the element’s bounds. You can use `overflow` to make a masking effect.

### Differences from CSS

The USS `display` property supports only a small subset of the CSS `display` property’s available keyword values. The USS version supports keywords that work with the Yoga layout engine.

- For more information about Yoga, refer to [Flexible Layouts with Yoga](https://yogalayout.com/).
- For more information about the CSS `display` property, refer to the [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display).

## Text properties

Text properties set the color, font, font size, and Unity-specific properties for font resource, font style, alignment, word wrap, and clipping.

```
color: <color>
-unity-font: <resource> | <url>
-unity-font-definition: <resource> | <url>
font-size: <number>
-unity-font-style: normal | italic | bold | bold-and-italic
-unity-text-align: upper-left | middle-left | lower-left | upper-center | middle-center | lower-center | upper-right | middle-right | lower-right
-unity-text-overflow-position: start | middle | end
white-space: normal | nowrap | pre | pre-wrap

-unity-text-outline-width: <length>
-unity-text-outline-color: <color>
/* Shorthand */
-unity-text-outline: <length> | <color>

-unity-text-generator: standard | advanced
-unity-text-auto-size: none | best-fit <min-font-size> <max-font-size>

/* The text overflow mode. */
/* clip: Trims any text that extends beyond the boudaries of its container. */
/* ellipsis: Truncates any text that extends beyong the boudaries of its container with an ellipsis. */
text-overflow: clip | ellipsis

text-shadow: <x-offset> <y-offset> <blur-radius> <color>;

letter-spacing: <length>
word-spacing: <length>
-unity-paragraph-spacing: <length>
```

**Note**: When you set up the font in UI Builder, the **Font** control in the ****Inspector**** sets `-unity-font`, and the **Font Asset** control sets `-unity-font-definition`. Because `-unity-font-definition` takes precedence over `-unity-font`, to use a font from the **Font** list, select **None** from **Font Asset**. Otherwise, the font you selected doesn’t take effect.

For more information about text shadow and text outline, refer to Text effects.

For more information about text generator and auto sizing, refer to Advanced Text Generator.

## Cursor

The `cursor` property specifies the mouse cursor to be displayed when the mouse pointer is over an element.

```
cursor: [ [ <resource> | <url> ] [ <integer> <integer>]? , ] [ arrow | text | resize-vertical | resize-horizontal | link | slide-arrow | resize-up-right | resize-up-left | move-arrow | rotate-arrow | scale-arrow | arrow-plus | arrow-minus | pan | orbit | zoom | fps | split-resize-up-down | split-resize-left-right ]
```

**Note**: Cursor keywords are only available in the Editor UI. Cursor keywords don’t work in runtime UI. In runtime UI, you must use a texture for custom cursors.

### Differences from CSS

In CSS, you can specify multiple optional custom cursors and a mandatory keyword in a single `cursor` style declaration. When you specify multiple cursors, they form a fallback chain. If the browser can’t load the first custom cursor, it tries each of the others in sequence until one of them loads or there are no more custom cursors to try. If the browser can’t load any custom cursors, it uses the keyword.

In USS, custom cursors and keywords are mutually exclusive. A `cursor` style declaration can only have one custom cursor or one keyword.

For detailed information about the CSS `cursor` property, refer to the [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/cursor).

## Opacity

```
opacity: <number>
```

### Differences from CSS

USS opacity is similar to [CSS opacity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/opacity). The opacity of parent elements affects the **perceived opacity** of child elements. The perceivability is different between USS opacity and CSS opacity.

In the following USS example, the blue square is a child of the red square. The red square has an `opacity` of `0.5`.

```
.red {
    background-color: red;
    opacity: 0.5;
}

.blue {
    background-color: blue;
    left: 20px;
    top: 20px;
}
```

Although the blue square doesn’t have an opacity value, it has a perceived opacity of `0.5` from the red square. You can see the red square through the blue square.

In CSS, if you apply the same styles, both the red and blue squares are 50% transparent. However, you can’t see the red square through the blue square, unless you also set the `opacity` of blue to be less than `1`.

## Material

```
-unity-material: <resource> | <url> | none
```

The `-unity-material` property assigns a custom material to the element. For more information, refer to Get started with UI Shader Graph.

**Note**: This property is automatically inherited by descendant elements, meaning child elements use the same material but they can override it.
