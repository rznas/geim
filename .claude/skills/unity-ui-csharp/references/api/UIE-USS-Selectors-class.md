# Class selectors

USS class selectors match elements that have specific USS classes assigned. USS class selectors are analogous to CSS class selectors.

## Syntax

A class selector consists of the class name prefixed with a period. Class names are case-sensitive and can’t begin with a numeral.

```
.className { ... }
```

Only use a period when you write the selector in a USS file. Don’t include it when you assign the class to an element in a UXML or C# file. For example, don’t use `<Button class=".yellow" />`.

In general, don’t include a period in class names. Unity’s USS parser interprets a period as the beginning of a new class. For example, if you create a class called `yellow.button`, and create the following USS rule: `.yellow.button{...}`. The parser interprets the selector as a multiple selector, and tries to find elements that match both a `.yellow` class and a `.button` class.

When an element has more than one class assigned, a selector only has to match one of them to match the element.

You can also specify multiple classes in a selector, in which case an element must have all of those classes assigned in order to match. See Multiple selectors for details.

## Example

To demonstrate how simple selectors match elements, here is an example UI Document.

```
<UXML xmlns="UnityEngine.UIElements">
  <VisualElement name="container1">
    <VisualElement name="container2" class="yellow">
      <Button name="OK" class="yellow" text="OK" />
      <Button name="Cancel" text="Cancel" />
    </VisualElement>
  </VisualElement>
</UXML>
```

With no styles applied, the UI looks like the following:

The following name class selector style rule matches the element `container2` and the button element `OK`, and changes their background to yellow.

```
.yellow {
    background-color: yellow;
}
```

The UI looks like the following when you apply the style:
