# ProgressBar

A ProgressBar element displays the progress of an ongoing task or process. Use it to provide visual feedback to the user about the progress of a task, such as file downloads, game level loading, or any other task that might take a while to complete.

You can set low and high values for the ProgressBar. The ProgressBar’s current value is constrained within these bounds. `0` is the lowest value that the ProgressBar can have.

## Create a ProgressBar

You can create a ProgressBar with UI Builder, UXML, and C#.

To create a ProgressBar with C#, create a new instance of a ProgressBar object. For example:

```
ProgressBar myElement = new ProgressBar("Label text");
```

## Customize the bar

To change the style of the bar, use the `.unity-progress-bar__progress` USS selector. For example, the following USS changes the size and the color of the bar:

```
.unity-progress-bar__progress {
    width: 20px;
    height: 50px;
    background-color: yellow;
}
```

## C# base class and namespace

**C# class**: `ProgressBar`
 **Namespace**: `UnityEngine.UIElements`
 **Base class**: `AbstractProgressBar`

## Inherited UXML attributes

This element inherits the following attributes from its base class:

| **Name** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `binding-path` | `string` | Path of the target property to be bound. |
| `focusable` | `boolean` | If false, this prevents the element from being focused.  The element can only be focused if its canGrabFocus property is true. |
| `high-value` | `float` | Sets the maximum value of the ProgressBar. |
| `low-value` | `float` | Sets the minimum value of the ProgressBar. |
| `tabindex` | `int` | An integer used to sort focusable elements in the focus ring. Must be greater than or equal to zero.  Setting the `tabIndex` value to less than `0` (for example, `−1`) removes the element from the focus ring and tab navigation. |
| `title` | `string` | Sets the title of the ProgressBar that displays in the center of the control. |
| `value` | `float` | Sets the progress value. The value is clamped between lowValue and highValue.  The progress percentage is calculated as `100 * (value - lowValue) / (highValue - lowValue)`.      If the value has changed, dispatches an `ChangeEvent_1` of type float. |

This element also inherits the following attributes from `VisualElement`:

| **Name** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `content-container` | `string` | Logical container where child elements are added. If a child is added to this element, the child is added to this element’s content container instead.  When iterating over the `VisualElement.Children` of an element, the element’s content container hierarchy is used instead of the element itself. This can lead to unexpected results, such as elements being ignored by the navigation events if they are not directly in the content container’s hierarchy. Refer to `IFocusRing` for more information.    If the content container is the same as the element itself, child elements are added directly to the element. This is true for most elements but can be overridden by more complex types.   The `ScrollView`, for example, has a content container that is different from itself. In that case, child elements added to the scroll view are added to its content container element instead. While the physical parent (`VisualElement.Hierarchy.parent`) of the child elements is the scroll view’s content container element, their logical parent (`VisualElement.parent`) still refers to the scroll view itself. Since some of the scroll view’s focusable children are not part of its logical hierarchy, like its `Scroller` elements, these focusable children are not considered by default when using sequential navigation. Refer to How can I change what element is focused next for an example of a workaround solution if the default navigation rules don’t correspond to your needs. |
| `data-source` | `Object` | Assigns a data source to this VisualElement which overrides any inherited data source. This data source is inherited by all children. |
| `data-source-path` | `string` | Path from the data source to the value. |
| `data-source-type` | `System.Type` | The possible type of data source assignable to this VisualElement.    This information is only used by the UI Builder as a hint to provide some completion to the data source path field when the effective data source cannot be specified at design time. |
| `enabled` | `boolean` | Returns true if the `VisualElement` is enabled locally.  This flag isn’t changed if the VisualElement is disabled implicitly by one of its parents. To verify this, use `enabledInHierarchy`. |
| `language-direction` | `UIElements.LanguageDirection` | Indicates the directionality of the element’s text. The value will propagate to the element’s children.  Setting `languageDirection` to `RTL` can only get the basic RTL support like text reversal. To get more comprehensive RTL support, such as line breaking, word wrapping, or text shaping, you must enable Advance Text Generator. |
| `name` | `string` | The name of this VisualElement.  Use this property to write USS selectors that target a specific element. The standard practice is to give an element a unique name. |
| `picking-mode` | `UIElements.PickingMode` | Determines if this element can be the target of pointer events or picked by `IPanel.Pick` queries.  Elements can not be picked if:  - They are invisible- Their `style.display` is set to `DisplayStyle.None`   Elements with a picking mode of `PickingMode.Ignore` never receive the hover pseudo-state. |
| `style` | `string` | Sets the style values on a `VisualElement`.  The returned style data, computed from USS files or inline styles written to this object in C#, doesn’t represent the fully resolved styles, such as the final height and width of a VisualElement. To access these fully resolved styles, use `resolvedStyle`.      For information about how to use this property and all the supported USS properties, refer to the Apply styles in C# scripts and USS properties reference manual pages. |
| `tooltip` | `string` | Text to display inside an information box after the user hovers the element for a small amount of time. This is only supported in the Editor UI. |
| `usage-hints` | `UIElements.UsageHints` | A combination of hint values that specify high-level intended usage patterns for the `VisualElement`. This property can only be set when the `VisualElement` is not yet part of a `Panel`. Once part of a `Panel`, this property becomes effectively read-only, and attempts to change it will throw an exception. The specification of proper `UsageHints` drives the system to make better decisions on how to process or accelerate certain operations based on the anticipated usage pattern. Note that those hints do not affect behavioral or visual results, but only affect the overall performance of the panel and the elements within. It’s advised to always consider specifying the proper `UsageHints`, but keep in mind that some `UsageHints` might be internally ignored under certain conditions (e.g. due to hardware limitations on the target platform). |
| `view-data-key` | `string` | Used for view data persistence, such as tree expanded states, scroll position, or zoom level.  This key is used to save and load the view data from the view data store. If you don’t set this key, the persistence is disabled for the associated `VisualElement`. For more information, refer to View data persistence in the Unity Manual. |

## USS classes

The following table lists all the C# public property names and their related USS selector.

| **C# property** | **USS selector** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ussClassName` | `.unity-progress-bar` | USS Class Name used to style the `ProgressBar`. |
| `containerUssClassName` | `.unity-progress-bar__container` | USS Class Name used to style the container of the `ProgressBar`. |
| `titleUssClassName` | `.unity-progress-bar__title` | USS Class Name used to style the title of the `ProgressBar`. |
| `titleContainerUssClassName` | `.unity-progress-bar__title-container` | USS Class Name used to style the container of the title of the `ProgressBar`. |
| `progressUssClassName` | `.unity-progress-bar__progress` | USS Class Name used to style the progress bar of the `ProgressBar`. |
| `backgroundUssClassName` | `.unity-progress-bar__background` | USS Class Name used to style the background of the `ProgressBar`. |
| `disabledUssClassName` | `.unity-disabled` | USS class name of local disabled elements. |

You can also use the Matching Selectors section in the Inspector or the UI Toolkit Debugger to see which USS selectors affect the components of the `VisualElement` at every level of its hierarchy.
