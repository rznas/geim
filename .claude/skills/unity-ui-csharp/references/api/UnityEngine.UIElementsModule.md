### Classes

| Class | Description |
| --- | --- |
| AbstractGenericMenu | Base class for menu functionality. |
| AbstractProgressBar | Abstract base class for the ProgressBar. |
| AlignmentUtils | Static class containing utility methods for aligning visual elements. |
| AttachToPanelEvent | Event sent after an element is added to an element that is a descendant of a panel. |

| BaseBoolField | A BaseBoolField is a clickable element that represents a boolean value. |
| BaseCompositeField<T0,T1,T2> | This is the base class for the composite fields. |
| BaseField<T0> | Abstract base class for controls.A BaseField is a base class for field elements like TextField and IntegerField. To align a BaseField element automatically with other fields in an Inspector window, use the .unity-base-field__aligned USS class. This style class is designed for use with Inspector elements like PropertyField, which has the style class by default. However, if you manually add a child BaseField element to a PropertyField, you must add the style class manually.When the style class is present, the field automatically calculates the label width to align with other fields in the Inspector window. If there are IMGUI fields present, UI Toolkit fields are aligned with them for consistency and compatibility. |

| OverflowClipBox | Boxes against which the VisualElement content is clipped. |
| PanelRenderMode | Determines how a panel is rendered. |
| PanelScaleMode | Options that specify how elements in the panel scale when the screen size changes. See PanelSettings.scaleMode. |
| PanelScreenMatchMode | Options that specify how to scale the panel area when the aspect ratio of the current screen resolution does not match the reference resolution. See PanelSettings.screenMatchMode. |
| PenButton | Describes a PenButton. Based on W3 conventions: https://www.w3.org/TR/pointerevents2/#the-buttons-property. |
| PickingMode | Describes the picking behavior. See VisualElement.pickingMode. |
| Pivot | Enum value used to specify the origin point of a UIDocument. |
| PivotReferenceSize | Enum value used to specify the size used to compute the Pivot position. |
| Position | Defines how the position values are interpreted by the layout engine. |
| PropagationPhase | The propagation phases of an event. |
| Repeat | Defines how the background is repeated. |
| ScrollerVisibility | Options for controlling the visibility of scroll bars in the ScrollView. |
| ScrollViewMode | Configurations of the ScrollView to influence the layout of its contents and how scrollbars appear. ScrollView.mode |
| SelectionType | Controls how many items can be selected at once. |
| SliceType | The slice type determines whether the center of the image is scaled or tiled. |
| SliderDirection | This is the direction of the Slider and SliderInt. |
| SortDirection | The sort direction. |
| StyleKeyword | Keyword that can be used on any style value types. |
| TextAutoSizeMode | Defines how a text element adapts its font-size. |
| TextOverflow | Specifies how the text Element treats hidden overflow content. |

| TrickleDown | Use this enum to specify during which propagation phase the event handler is executed. |
| TwoPaneSplitViewOrientation | Determines the orientation of the two resizable panes. |
| UsageHints | Offers a set of options that describe the intended usage patterns of a VisualElement. These options serve as guidance for optimizations. You can set multiple usage hints on an element. For example, if both position and color change, you can set both DynamicTransform and DynamicColor. Note: Set the usage hints at edit time or before you add the VisualElement to a panel. In the case of transition, when it starts, the system might automatically add missing relevant usage hints to avoid regenerating geometry in every frame. However, this causes a one-frame performance penalty because the rendering data for the VisualElement and its descendants is regenerated. |
| VersionChangeType | Value used to signify some changes in the VisualElement |
| Visibility | Style value that specifies whether or not a VisualElement is visible. |
| WhiteSpace | Controls how whitespace and line breaks within an element's text are handled, similar to the CSS white-space property. Unlike the CSS property, only trailing whitespaces are collapsed, and whitespaces within the text are preserved. See white-space |
| Wrap | By default, items will all try to fit onto one line. You can change that and allow the items to wrap as needed with this property. |
