# Position element with the layout engine

UI Toolkit includes a layout engine that positions elements based on layout and styling properties. The layout engine uses the layout principles of [Yoga](https://yogalayout.com/), which implements a subset of [Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/), a HTML/CSS layout system. UI Toolkit properties match Yoga layout behavior. UI Toolkit supports most properties in Flexbox.

By default, all elements are part of the layout. The layout has the following default behaviours:

- A container distributes its children vertically.
- The position of a container rectangle includes its children rectangles. This behavior can be limited by other layout properties.
- A `VisualElement` with text uses the text size in its size calculations. This behavior can be limited by other layout properties.

UI Toolkit includes built-in controls for standard UI components, such as a button, toggle, or text field. These built-in controls have styles that affect their layout.

## Main style properties

The following are the main style properties:

- **Flex > Direction** (`flex-direction` in USS): Defines the layout direction the **main-axis**. The default is `column` and that makes the **main-axis** run from top to bottom.
- **Flex > Grow** (`flex-grow` in USS): Defines how much an element grows relative to its siblings along the **main-axis**. The value is a ratio shared with siblings in the same parent container. If you set `flex-grow: 1` on two children, they’ll each receive an equal share of the remaining space, but only if:
- Their `flex-basis` values are equal (or both set to `0`).
- Their initial sizes (content) don’t influence layout through `flex-basis: auto`.

To ensure an even split regardless of content, set both `flex-grow: 1` and `flex-basis: 0`. This tells the layout engine to ignore the content size when distributing space. - **Flex > Basis** (`flex-basis` in USS): Defines the initial size of an element along the **main-axis**. The default is `auto`, which means the size is based on the content size. You can set it to a specific value, such as `100px`, or to `0` to ignore the content size. - **Align > Align Items** (`align-items` in USS): Defines the alignment of elements in the **cross-axis**, or the perpendicular axis to the **main-axis**. For example, if you have two Buttons in a `VisualElement` that has `flex-direction: column` and `align-items: flex-end` set, the two Buttons will squish against the container’s right edge. The options for `align-items` have names like `flex-start` and `flex-end` because they depend on the value of `flex-direction`. - **Align > Justify Content** (`justify-content` in USS): Defines the alignment of elements in the **main-axis**. For example, if you have two Buttons in a `VisualElement` that has `flex-direction: column` and `justify-content: flex-end` set, the two Buttons squish against the container’s bottom edge. The options for `justify-content` are named like `flex-start` and `flex-end` because they depend on the value of `flex-direction`.

For more information, refer to Flex layout.

If the selected element has child elements, in UI Builder, you can use toggles in the header to toggle flex-related style properties in the ****Viewport****. The image below shows the options available for the `#menu` element:

You can use the style properties to create complex, dynamic layouts. Here’s an example of a layout that anchors a `Button` on the bottom-right edge of the screen:

The UXML for this layout, showing the inline styles set on each container `VisualElement`, is below:

```
<ui:UXML xmlns:ui="UnityEngine.UIElements" xmlns:uie="UnityEditor.UIElements">
    <ui:VisualElement name="screen-is-blue" style="flex-grow: 1; justify-content: flex-end; background-color: blue;">
        <ui:VisualElement name="toolbar-is-orange" style="align-items: flex-end; background-color: orange;">
            <ui:Button text="Button" display-tooltip-when-elided="true" />
        </ui:VisualElement>
    </ui:VisualElement>
</ui:UXML>
```

The containers are colored to reveal their shape. You can use nested `VisualElement` containers to achieve any dynamic layout without resorting to explicitly setting the position and size of each element. This keeps the layout dynamic and automatically adjusts to the larger container changing size, like the screen changing size.

## Absolute position

UI Builder also supports the **Position** style properties. The **Position > Absolute** mode makes an element invisible to the default Flexbox-based layout engine. It’s as if it no longer takes any space. **Absolute**-position elements appear on top of any siblings that are **Relative**-position.

While using **Absolute** position, you can use the **Position > Left**, **Top**, **Right**, **Bottom** style properties to offset and size the element from the respective edges of its parent. This doesn’t set absolute coordinates on the screen but sets offsets relative to the parent element. You can still use **Relative** mode to position the parent element. If you set both a **Left** offset and a **Right** offset, the **Width** style property of the element is ignored and the computed width will now come from the following formula:

```
element-computed-width = parent-width - left-offset - right-offset
```

**Left**, **Top**, **Right**, **Bottom** can also be interpreted as anchors. For example, you can anchor a `Button` on the bottom-left of the screen:

The UXML below displays the inline styles:

```
<ui:UXML xmlns:ui="UnityEngine.UIElements" xmlns:uie="UnityEditor.UIElements" editor-extension-mode="False">
    <ui:VisualElement style="flex-grow: 1;">
        <ui:VisualElement style="position: absolute; left: 0; bottom: 0;" />
    </ui:VisualElement>
</ui:UXML>
```

With positioning, there is a difference between having **Left** set to `0` and having **Left** unset:

- `Left set to 0` means set an offset of 0.
- `Left unset` doesn’t set any offset and lets other style properties define the width or height of the element.

You can also modify these offset style properties directly in the **Canvas** via additional resize handles on each edge and corner of the element’s blue selection border. It’s important to differentiate between what’s set and what’s unset, so the **Canvas** also includes “anchor” toggles as orange squares off each side of the element. The **Canvas** handles will adjust which style properties are set when resizing the element visually, depending on which “anchors” are set. For example, say you are resizing the element in the **Canvas** via its right-border handle:

- If you set both **Left** and **Right** properties, the handle will update the **Right** property.
- If you set **Left** but not **Right**, the handle will update the **Width** property.

## Use both Relative and Absolute

Avoid to use **Absolute** position mode because it bypasses the built-in layout engine in UI Toolkit and can lead to high-maintenance UI where changing the overall layout requires manually updating individual elements. However, **Absolute** positioning is appropriate for specific use cases, such as overlays. It’s useful to overlay some complex UI on top of other complex UI, such as a popup or a dropdown. In these cases, use **Absolute** position for the overlay container, but continue using **Relative** mode for elements inside the overlay to maintain flexibility.

The following shows an example of a simple centered popup:

And here’s the UXML for your reference:

```
<ui:UXML xmlns:ui="UnityEngine.UIElements" xmlns:uie="UnityEditor.UIElements">
    <ui:VisualElement name="complex-ui-screen">
        <ui:Toggle label="Toggle" />
        <ui:MinMaxSlider picking-mode="Ignore" label="Min/Max Slider" min-value="10" max-value="12" low-limit="-10" high-limit="40" />
        <ui:Label text="Label" />
        <ui:Button text="Button" />
        <ui:Button text="Button" />
    </ui:VisualElement>
    <ui:VisualElement name="overlay" style="position: absolute; left: 0; top: 0; right: 0; bottom: 0; background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.71); align-items: center; justify-content: center;">
        <ui:VisualElement name="popup" style="background-color: rgba(70, 70, 70, 255);">
            <ui:Label text="Exit?" name="message" />
            <ui:Button text="OK" name="ok-button" style="width: 108.3333px;" />
        </ui:VisualElement>
    </ui:VisualElement>
</ui:UXML>
```

The example above highlights the use of **Absolute** position. Set all **Position > Left**, **Top**, **Right**, **Bottom** to `0`, so the position is `0` pixels away from the edges of the screen. This makes the `#overlay` element overlap the `#complex-ui-screen` container element. You can also set a semi-transparent background to the `#overlay` element to make the other UI appear darkened. Use `#overlay` to set **Relative** position to center our `#popup` container `VisualElement`.

## Best practices

The following list provides tips to help improve the performance of the layout engine:

- Set the `width` and `height` to define the size of an element.
- Use the `flexGrow` property (USS: `flex-grow: <value>;`) to assign a flexible size to an element. The value of the `flexGrow` property assigns a base weight to the size of an element when it’s determined by its siblings.
- Set the `flexDirection` property to `row` (USS: `flex-direction: row;`) to switch to a horizontal layout.
- Use relative positioning to offset an element based on its original layout position.
- Set the `position` property to `absolute` to place an element relative to its parent position rectangle. This doesn’t affect the layout of its siblings or parent.
- To layout your custom Editor UI, such as a custom Inspector, you can leverage the built-in UI Toolkit components and styles. The recommended way to ensure proper alignment and spacing is to use BaseField elements and apply the `.unity-base-field__aligned` USS class. This automatically handles the default horizontal separation between labels and controls.
