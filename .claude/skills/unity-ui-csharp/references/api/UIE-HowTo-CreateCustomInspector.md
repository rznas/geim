# Create a custom Inspector

**Version**: 2022.3+

Although there is a default **Inspector** for your MonoBehaviours and ScriptableObjects, you might want to write a custom Inspector for your classes. A custom Inspector can help you do the following:

- Create a more user-friendly representation of script properties.
- Organize and group properties together.
- Display or hide sections of the UI depending on the user’s choices.
- Provide additional information about the meaning of individual settings and properties.

## Example overview

This example creates a custom Inspector for a MonoBehaviour class. It uses both C# **scripts** and UI Builder to create the UI. The custom Inspector also features a custom **property drawer**.

The custom Inspector displays the properties of a `Car` class, including the make, year built, color, and a list of tires. The Inspector uses a PropertyField control to display the properties of the `Car` class, and a custom property drawer to display the properties of the `Tire` class.

You can find the completed files that this example creates in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ui-toolkit-manual-code-examples/tree/master/create-a-custom-inspector).

## Prerequisites

This guide is for developers familiar with the Unity Editor, UI Toolkit, and C# scripting. Before you start, get familiar with the following:

- Visual Tree
- SerializedObject data binding
- UI Builder
- Foldout
- PropertyField
- PropertyDrawer

## Create a new MonoBehaviour

To create a custom Inspector, first define a custom class that inherits from a `MonoBehaviour`. The custom class represents a simple `car` with several properties.

1. Create a project in Unity with any template.
2. In your **Project window**, create a folder named `create-a-custom-inspector` to store all your files.
3. Create a C# script named `Car.cs` with the following content: `using UnityEngine; public class Car : MonoBehaviour { public string m_Make = "Toyota"; public int m_YearBuilt = 1980; public Color m_Color = Color.black; }`
4. Create a new **GameObject** in the **scene** and attach the `Car` script component to it.   Default Inspector for the Car object

## Create a custom Inspector script

To create a custom Inspector for any serialized object, you need to create a class deriving from the Editor base class and add the CustomEditor attribute to it. This attribute lets Unity know which class this custom Inspector represents.

**Note**: The custom Inspector script must be in an `Editor` folder or an Editor-only assembly definition. This is because the `UnityEditor` namespace, which is essential for creating custom Inspectors, isn’t accessible outside these areas. If you try to create standalone builds without adhering to this, the build process fails.

1. Create a folder named `Editor` inside the `create-a-custom-inspector` folder.
2. Create a C# script named `Car_Inspector.cs` inside the `Editor` folder with the following content: `using UnityEditor; using UnityEditor.UIElements; using UnityEngine.UIElements; [CustomEditor(typeof(Car))] public class Car_Inspector : Editor { }`
3. Select the GameObject that has the `Car` component attached to it. The default Inspector displays.
4. To replace the default Inspector, inside the `Car_Inspector` class, add the following code to override CreateInspectorGUI() and return a new **visual element** containing the UI: `public override VisualElement CreateInspectorGUI() { // Create a new VisualElement to be the root of our Inspector UI. VisualElement myInspector = new VisualElement(); // Add a simple label. myInspector.Add(new Label("This is a custom Inspector")); // Return the finished Inspector UI. return myInspector; }`
5. Select the GameObject that has the `Car` component attached to it. The Inspector now displays the label `This is a custom Inspector` instead of the default Inspector.   Custom Inspector with a label

## Create a custom Inspector UI with UI Builder

You can create a custom Inspector UI with UI Builder, and use C# script to load and instantiate the UI from the UXML file.

1. To open the UI Builder, select **Window** > **UI Toolkit** > **UI Builder**.
2. Select **File** > **New** to create a new Visual Tree Asset.   Custom Inspector with a label
3. To enable Editor-only controls in UI Builder, select the `<unsaved file>*.uxml` in the **Hierarchy** view and then select the **Editor Extension Authoring** checkbox.   Custom Inspector with a label
4. Drag a label control from the **Library** to the **Hierarchy**. This adds a label control to the visual tree.   Custom Inspector with a label
5. In the label control’s Inspector panel, update the label text.   Custom Inspector with a label
6. Select **File** > **Save** and save the visual tree as `Car_Inspector_UXML.uxml` to the `Assets/create-a-custom-inspector` folder.

## Use UXML inside a custom Inspector

To use the UXML file you created inside your custom Inspector, assign the file to the custom Inspector, and load and clone it inside the `CreateInspectorGUI()` function and add it to the visual tree. To do this, you can use the CloneTree method. You can pass any `VisualElement` as a parameter to act as a parent for the created elements.

1. In `Car_Inspector.cs`, create a public variable for a `VisualTreeAsset` in your script and assign `Car_Inspector_UXML.uxml` to it. `public VisualTreeAsset m_InspectorUXML;`
2. Update the `CreateInspectorGUI()` method to load the UXML file and clone it into the visual tree. The finished `Car_Inspector.cs` file looks like the following: `using UnityEditor; using UnityEditor.UIElements; using UnityEngine.UIElements; [CustomEditor(typeof(Car))] public class Car_Inspector : Editor { public VisualTreeAsset m_InspectorUXML; public override VisualElement CreateInspectorGUI() { // Create a new VisualElement to be the root of our Inspector UI. VisualElement myInspector = new VisualElement(); // Add a simple label. myInspector.Add(new Label("This is a custom Inspector")); // Load the UXML file and clone its tree into the inspector. if (m_InspectorUXML != null) { VisualElement uxmlContent = m_InspectorUXML.CloneTree(); myInspector.Add(uxmlContent); } // Return the finished Inspector UI. return myInspector; } }`
3. In the Inspector window of `Car_Inspector.cs`, assign the `Car_Inspector_UXML.uxml` file to the **Inspector UXML** field.
4. Select the GameObject that has the `Car` component attached to it. The Inspector for the `Car` component now displays two labels: one through script, and one through UI Builder/UXML.   Custom Inspector with two labels label

## Bind a text field

This custom Inspector displays all properties of the `Car` class. When you update the UI controls, the values inside the instance of the `Car` class change. To do so, add UI controls to the visual tree and bind them to the individual properties of the class.

To bind a control to a serialized property, assign the property to the `binding-path` field of the control. When you create a custom inspector, binding is automatic. `CreateInspectorGUI()` does an implicit bind after you return your visual tree. For more information, refer to SerializedObject data binding.

1. Double-click `Car_Inspector_UXML.uxml` to open it in UI Builder.
2. Add a **TextField control**.   Add a text field to the UI
3. In the Inspector panel of the TextField, set the label text to `Make of the car`.
4. Set the binding path to `m_Make`.   Bind a property to a control in UI Builder
5. Add a style class `unity-base-field__aligned` to the **Style Class List** so that the text field aligns with other fields in the Inspector window. For more information, refer to BaseField.   Add a style class to the text field
6. In UI Builder, select **File** > **Save**.
7. Select the GameObject that has the `Car` component attached to it. The Inspector for the `car` component now displays the `Make of the car` text field. The text field is bound to the `m_Make` property of the `Car` class.   Custom Inspector showing a text field

## Bind a property field

To display the properties of the `Car` class, add a control for each field. The control must match the property type. For example, you must bind an `int` to an Integer field or an Integer Slider.

Instead of adding a specific control based on the property type, you can use the generic PropertyField control. This control works for most types of serialized properties and generates the default Inspector UI for this property type.

The advantage of a `PropertyField` is the Inspector UI automatically adjusts when you change the variable type inside your script. However, you can’t get a preview of the control inside the UI Builder because the control type is unknown until the visual tree is bound to a serialized object.

1. Double-click `Car_Inspector_UXML.uxml` to open it in UI Builder.
2. Add a PropertyField control for the `m_YearBuilt` properties of the `Car` class, and set the binding path and the label text.   Add a property field in UI Builder
3. Add a style class `unity-base-field__aligned` to the **Style Class List**.
4. Add a PropertyField control for the `m_Color` properties of the `Car` class, and set the binding path and the label text.
5. Add a style class `unity-base-field__aligned` to the **Style Class List**.
6. In UI Builder, select **File** > **Save**.
7. Select the GameObject that has the `Car` component to it. The Inspector for the `car` component now displays the `Year Built` and `Paint Color` property fields.   Custom Inspector with property fields

## Create a custom property drawer

A custom property drawer is a custom Inspector UI for a custom serializable class. If that serializable class is part of another serialized object, the custom UI displays that property in the Inspector. In UI Toolkit, the `PropertyField` control displays the custom property drawer for a field if one exists.

1. In the `create-a-custom-inspector` folder, create a new script named `Tire.cs` with the following content: `using System.Collections; using System.Collections.Generic; using UnityEngine; [System.Serializable] public class Tire { public float m_AirPressure = 21.5f; public int m_ProfileDepth = 4; }`
2. In `Car.cs`, add a list `Tire` to the `Car` class. The finished `Car.cs` file looks like the following: `using UnityEngine; public class Car : MonoBehaviour { public string m_Make = "Toyota"; public int m_YearBuilt = 1980; public Color m_Color = Color.black; // This car has four tires. public Tire[] m_Tires = new Tire[4]; }`
3. The PropertyField control works with all standard property types and also supports custom serializable classes and arrays. To display the properties of the car’s tires, add another `PropertyField` in `Car_Inspector_UXML.uxml` and bind it to `m_Tires`. The finished `Car_Inspector_UXML.uxml` file looks like the following: `<ui:UXML xmlns:ui="UnityEngine.UIElements" xmlns:uie="UnityEditor.UIElements" editor-extension-mode="True"> <ui:TextField picking-mode="Ignore" label="Make of the car" value="filler text" binding-path="m_Make" class="unity-base-field__aligned" /> <uie:PropertyField binding-path="m_YearBuilt" label="Year Built" class="unity-base-field__aligned" /> <uie:PropertyField binding-path="m_Color" label="Paint Color" class="unity-base-field__aligned" /> <uie:PropertyField label="Tires" binding-path="m_Tires" class="unity-base-field__aligned" /> </ui:UXML>`
4. Select the GameObject with the `Car` component. The Inspector for the `car` component now displays the `Tires` property field.   Use a PropertyField control to display an array

## Create UI for the custom property drawer

You can create a custom property drawer to customize the look of the individual `Tire` elements in the list. Instead of deriving from the `Editor` base class, custom property drawers derive from the `PropertyDrawer` class.

You can use C# script or UXML to create the UI for the property. This example uses C# script to create the custom UI. To create UI for the custom property, override the CreatePropertyGUI method.

1. In the `Editor` folder, Create a new script named `Tire_PropertyDrawer.cs` with the following content: `using UnityEditor; using UnityEditor.UIElements; using UnityEngine.UIElements; [CustomPropertyDrawer(typeof(Tire))] public class Tire_PropertyDrawer : PropertyDrawer { public override VisualElement CreatePropertyGUI(SerializedProperty property) { // Create drawer UI using C#. var popup = new UnityEngine.UIElements.PopupWindow(); popup.text = "Tire Details"; popup.Add(new PropertyField(property.FindPropertyRelative("m_AirPressure"), "Air Pressure (psi)")); popup.Add(new PropertyField(property.FindPropertyRelative("m_ProfileDepth"), "Profile Depth (mm)")); // Return the finished UI. return popup; } }`
2. Select the GameObject that has the `Car` component to it. The Inspector for the `car` component now displays the `Tires` property field with a custom property drawer.   Inspector using a custom property drawer
