# Install a UPM package from a local folder

The Package Manager can load a **UPM package** from anywhere on your computer even if you saved it outside your Unity project folder (for example, if you have a package called **com.unity.my-local-package** and you save it on the `Desktop` but your Unity project is under the `Documents` folder).

You can also use a folder inside your project folder, provided that it is not one of the reserved project sub-folders.

To install a UPM package from your local disk:

1. Open the Package Manager window, if it’s not already open.
2. Click the **install**  button in the toolbar. The options for installing packages appear.   Install package from disk button
3. Select **Install package from disk** from the install menu to bring up a file browser.
4. Navigate to the folder root of your **local package**.
5. Double-click the `package.json` file in the file browser.

The file browser closes, and the package now appears in the package list with the  label.

Remember that if you updated to the registry version but you made changes locally to your project, the registry version will overwrite your local changes.

## Local packages inside your project

You can place a local package anywhere inside your project except under these folders:

| **Project folder:** | **Reason:** |
| --- | --- |
| `Assets` | If you place a package inside this folder, the Asset Database imports any assets under this folder twice: once as assets and once as package contents. |
| `Library` | Do not modify the contents of this folder. |
| `ProjectSettings` | This folder is for settings assets only. |
| `Packages` | If you place a package under this folder, the Package Manager automatically interprets it as an **Embedded package**, regardless of the reference in the **project manifest**. |
