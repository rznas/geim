# Hash128Field

The Hash128Field lets users enter a Hash128 value in a UI.

**Note**: To align an element with other fields in an **Inspector** window, simply apply the `.unity-base-field__aligned` USS class to it. For more information, refer to `BaseField`.

## Create a Hash128Field

You can create a Hash128Field with UI Builder, UXML, or C#. The following C# example creates a Hash128Field with a Hash128 value:

```
var hash128Field = new Hash128Field();
hash128Field.label = "Label text:";
hash128Field.value = new Hash128(0x8f14e45f, 0xceea167a, 0x5a36dedd, 0x4bea2543);
```

## C# class and namespace

**C# class**: `Hash128Field`
 **Namespace**: `UnityEngine.UIElements`
 **Base class**: `TextInputBaseField_1`

## Inherited UXML attributes

This element inherits the following attributes from its base class:

| **Name** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `auto-correction` | `boolean` | Determines if the touch screen keyboard auto correction is turned on or off. |
| `binding-path` | `string` | Path of the target property to be bound. |
| `emoji-fallback-support` | `boolean` | Specifies the order in which the system should look for Emoji characters when rendering text. If this setting is enabled, the global Emoji Fallback list will be searched first for characters defined as Emoji in the Unicode 14.0 standard. |
| `focusable` | `boolean` | If false, this prevents the element from being focused.  The element can only be focused if its canGrabFocus property is true. |
| `hide-mobile-input` | `boolean` | Hides or shows the mobile input field. |
| `hide-placeholder-on-focus` | `boolean` | Hides the placeholder on focus. |
| `is-delayed` | `boolean` | If set to true, the value property isn’t updated until either the user presses Enter or the text field loses focus. |
| `keyboard-type` | `TouchScreenKeyboardType` | The type of mobile keyboard that will be used. |
| `label` | `string` | The string representing the label that will appear beside the field. If the string is empty, the label element is removed from the hierarchy. If the string is not empty, the label element is added to the hierarchy. |
| `mask-character` | `System.Char` | The character used for masking in a password field. |
| `max-length` | `int` | Maximum number of characters for the field. |
| `password` | `boolean` | Returns true if the field is used to edit a password. |
| `placeholder-text` | `string` | A short hint to help users understand what to enter in the field. |
| `readonly` | `boolean` | Returns true if the field is read only. |
| `select-all-on-focus` | `boolean` | Controls whether the element’s content is selected upon receiving focus. |
| `select-all-on-mouse-up` | `boolean` | Controls whether the element’s content is selected when you mouse up for the first time. |
| `select-line-by-triple-click` | `boolean` | Controls whether triple clicking selects the entire line under the mouse pointer or not. |
| `select-word-by-double-click` | `boolean` | Controls whether double-clicking selects the word under the mouse pointer. |
| `tabindex` | `int` | An integer used to sort focusable elements in the focus ring. Must be greater than or equal to zero.  Setting the `tabIndex` value to less than `0` (for example, `−1`) removes the element from the focus ring and tab navigation. |
| `value` | `Hash128` | The value associated with the field. |
| `vertical-scroller-visibility` | `UIElements.ScrollerVisibility` | Option for controlling the visibility of the vertical scroll bar in the `TextInputBaseField_1`. |

This element also inherits the following attributes from `VisualElement`:

| **Name** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `content-container` | `string` | Logical container where child elements are added. If a child is added to this element, the child is added to this element’s content container instead.  When iterating over the `VisualElement.Children` of an element, the element’s content container hierarchy is used instead of the element itself. This can lead to unexpected results, such as elements being ignored by the navigation events if they are not directly in the content container’s hierarchy. Refer to `IFocusRing` for more information.    If the content container is the same as the element itself, child elements are added directly to the element. This is true for most elements but can be overridden by more complex types.   The `ScrollView`, for example, has a content container that is different from itself. In that case, child elements added to the scroll view are added to its content container element instead. While the physical parent (`VisualElement.Hierarchy.parent`) of the child elements is the scroll view’s content container element, their logical parent (`VisualElement.parent`) still refers to the scroll view itself. Since some of the scroll view’s focusable children are not part of its logical hierarchy, like its `Scroller` elements, these focusable children are not considered by default when using sequential navigation. Refer to How can I change what element is focused next for an example of a workaround solution if the default navigation rules don’t correspond to your needs. |
| `data-source` | `Object` | Assigns a data source to this VisualElement which overrides any inherited data source. This data source is inherited by all children. |
| `data-source-path` | `string` | Path from the data source to the value. |
| `data-source-type` | `System.Type` | The possible type of data source assignable to this VisualElement.    This information is only used by the UI Builder as a hint to provide some completion to the data source path field when the effective data source cannot be specified at design time. |
| `enabled` | `boolean` | Returns true if the `VisualElement` is enabled locally.  This flag isn’t changed if the VisualElement is disabled implicitly by one of its parents. To verify this, use `enabledInHierarchy`. |
| `language-direction` | `UIElements.LanguageDirection` | Indicates the directionality of the element’s text. The value will propagate to the element’s children.  Setting `languageDirection` to `RTL` can only get the basic RTL support like text reversal. To get more comprehensive RTL support, such as line breaking, word wrapping, or text shaping, you must enable Advance Text Generator. |
| `name` | `string` | The name of this VisualElement.  Use this property to write USS selectors that target a specific element. The standard practice is to give an element a unique name. |
| `picking-mode` | `UIElements.PickingMode` | Determines if this element can be the target of pointer events or picked by `IPanel.Pick` queries.  Elements can not be picked if:  - They are invisible- Their `style.display` is set to `DisplayStyle.None`   Elements with a picking mode of `PickingMode.Ignore` never receive the hover pseudo-state. |
| `style` | `string` | Sets the style values on a `VisualElement`.  The returned style data, computed from USS files or inline styles written to this object in C#, doesn’t represent the fully resolved styles, such as the final height and width of a VisualElement. To access these fully resolved styles, use `resolvedStyle`.      For information about how to use this property and all the supported USS properties, refer to the Apply styles in C# scripts and USS properties reference manual pages. |
| `tooltip` | `string` | Text to display inside an information box after the user hovers the element for a small amount of time. This is only supported in the Editor UI. |
| `usage-hints` | `UIElements.UsageHints` | A combination of hint values that specify high-level intended usage patterns for the `VisualElement`. This property can only be set when the `VisualElement` is not yet part of a `Panel`. Once part of a `Panel`, this property becomes effectively read-only, and attempts to change it will throw an exception. The specification of proper `UsageHints` drives the system to make better decisions on how to process or accelerate certain operations based on the anticipated usage pattern. Note that those hints do not affect behavioral or visual results, but only affect the overall performance of the panel and the elements within. It’s advised to always consider specifying the proper `UsageHints`, but keep in mind that some `UsageHints` might be internally ignored under certain conditions (e.g. due to hardware limitations on the target platform). |
| `view-data-key` | `string` | Used for view data persistence, such as tree expanded states, scroll position, or zoom level.  This key is used to save and load the view data from the view data store. If you don’t set this key, the persistence is disabled for the associated `VisualElement`. For more information, refer to View data persistence in the Unity Manual. |
