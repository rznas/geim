# Draw order

The draw order of elements in the **visual tree** follows a depth-first search. Child **visual elements** appear on top of parent elements. UI Toolkit draws child elements in the order of the sibling list. The draw order is the following:

1. The top visual element.
2. The first child element of that visual element.
3. The child elements of the descendant element.

The diagram below shows the draw order of a visual tree:

To change the draw order of visual elements in C#, use the following functions:

- BringToFront()
- SendToBack()

To change the draw order of sibling visual elements, use the following functions:

- PlaceBehind()
- PlaceInFront()
