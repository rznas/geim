# Bindable data types and fields

This section describes the data type conversions and fields supported by `PropertyField`.

## Data type conversions

Most built-in controls in UI Toolkit implement the `INotifyValueChanged` interface for a specific data type. For example, `DoubleField` implements `INotifyValueChanged<Double>`, which means you can bind the `DoubleField` control to a property of type `double`. You can bind more data types with the binding system. For example, you can bind a property of type `int` to a `DoubleField`.

The following table lists the source and target data types that you can bind:

| **Source data type** | **Target data type of `INotifyValueChanged`** |
| --- | --- |
| `long` | `long` `int` `string` `float` |
| `int` | `int` `string` `float` |
| `double` | `double` `float` |
| `float` | `float` `double` |
| `char` | `char` `string` |

**Note**: To prevent data loss, use a `PropertyField` or use the appropriate data types as shown in the Fields supported by PropertyField table below.

## Fields supported by `PropertyField`

When the **Inspector** window is populated, if a custom Editor doesn’t exist for a type, the binding system calls `InspectorElement.FillDefaultInspector()`. This creates a `PropertyField` for each `SerializedProperty` on the `SerializedObject`.

Each `PropertyField` has a matching control under it, such as an `IntegerField` to represent an `int`, or a `Toggle` to represent a `bool`. If the property has sub-properties, the `PropertyField` has a `Foldout` control. That `Foldout` has the appropriate default controls under each sub-property. If you created a custom `PropertyDrawer` for a Property, the **visual tree** returned from the `PropertyDrawer`’s `CreatePropertyGUI()` method is used instead.

**Note**:

When you create a custom UI, don’t use a `PropertyField` unless you can’t find a specific control for it. For example, to create a control in your visual tree and bind it to a `Color`, use a `ColorField` rather than a `PropertyField`. This makes visual trees more lightweight and operations faster.

The use of `PropertyField` incurs additional overhead because it resolves the concrete field to use after binding. This extra step can affect performance. However, `PropertyField` is beneficial for some uses. For example, it supports custom drawers, which you can use to handle specific properties in a personalized way. This eliminates the need to guess the field type for drawing, which can reduce errors.

The following table lists fields supported by `PropertyField` and their data type:

| **Field** | **Data type** |
| --- | --- |
| `BoundsField` | Bounds |
| `BoundsIntField` | BoundsInt |
| `ColorField` | Color |
| `CurveField` | AnimationCurve |
| `FloatField` | float |
| `GradientField` | Gradient |
| `Hash128Field` | Hash128 |
| `IntegerField` | int |
| `IntegerField` | int, for the ArraySize |
| `LayerMaskField` | unit |
| `LongField` | long |
| `ObjectField` | UnityEngine.Object |
| `PopupField`<string> | Enum |
| `RectField` | Rect |
| `RectIntField` | RectInt |
| `TextField` | string |
| `TextField`, with a maxLength=1 | char |
| `Toggle` | bool |
| `Vector2Field` | Vector2 |
| `Vector2IntField` | Vector2Int |
| `Vector3Field` | Vector3 |
| `Vector3IntField` | Vector3Int |
| `Vector4Field` | Vector4 |
