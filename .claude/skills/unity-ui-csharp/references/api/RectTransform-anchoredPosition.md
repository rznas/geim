### Description

The position of the pivot of this RectTransform relative to the anchor reference point.

The Anchored Position is the position of the pivot of the RectTransform taking into consideration the anchor reference point. The anchor reference point is the position of the anchors. If the anchors are not together, Unity estimates the four anchor positions using the pivot placement as a reference.

 **Note**: The Inspector changes which properties are exposed based on which anchor preset is in use. For more information see Rect Transform and Basic Layout.

```csharp
using UnityEngine;public class Example : MonoBehaviour
{
    RectTransform m_RectTransform;
    float m_XAxis, m_YAxis;    void Start()
    {
        //Fetch the RectTransform from the GameObject
        m_RectTransform = GetComponent<RectTransform>();
        //Initiate the x and y positions
        m_XAxis = 0.5f;
        m_YAxis = 0.5f;
    }    void OnGUI()
    {
        //The Labels show what the Sliders represent
        GUI.Label(new Rect(0, 20, 150, 80), "Anchor Position X : ");
        GUI.Label(new Rect(300, 20, 150, 80), "Anchor Position Y : ");        //Create a horizontal Slider that controls the x and y Positions of the anchors
        m_XAxis = GUI.HorizontalSlider(new Rect(150, 20, 100, 80), m_XAxis, -50.0f, 50.0f);
        m_YAxis = GUI.HorizontalSlider(new Rect(450, 20, 100, 80), m_YAxis, -50.0f, 50.0f);        //Detect a change in the GUI Slider
        if (GUI.changed)
        {
            //Change the RectTransform's anchored positions depending on the Slider values
            m_RectTransform.anchoredPosition = new Vector2(m_XAxis, m_YAxis);
        }
    }
}
```
