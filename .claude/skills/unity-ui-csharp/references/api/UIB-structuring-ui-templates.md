# Use UXML instances as templates

You can instantiate existing UXML Documents as **Templates** inside your UXML Documents as **Template Instances**, similar to how Prefabs work in Unity.

## Use a UXML Document as a template

To use an existing UXML Document in your project as a template, do the following:

1. Under the **Library**’s **Project** tab, find the UXML Asset (`.uxml`) you wish to instantiate.
2. Drag it into the **Hierarchy** like an element in the **Library**.

A **Template Instance** appears in the **Hierarchy** like a normal element of type `TemplateContainer`. The name of the `.uxml` file displays as greyed font to the right of its name. If you expand the **Template Instance**, you can see the internal hierarchy of the instance. This internal hierarchy, as explained in Working with elements, is read-only and only for reference.

## Make a Sub-Document as a template

You can make a Sub-Document within a UXML Document as a **Template Instance**, so you can reuse it.

1. Right-click on the Sub-Document.
2. Select **Create Template**.
3. Select a location to save the file.

This also instantiates the Sub-Document as **Template Instances** in the existing document.

**Note:** The properties of the parent or child elements of Sub-Document do not apply to the template container element.

## Edit a UXML document template instance

To edit an original UXML Document used as a **Template Instance**, right-click on a **Template Instance**, and select one of the following options:

- **Open in UI Builder**: Unload the current UXML Document, and load the **Template Instance**:   Open in UI Builder example
- **Open Instance in Isolation**: Keep the current UXML Document loaded in the background while loading **Template Instance**. The **Hierarchy** and the **Canvas** only display the contents of the **Template Instance**, and the **StyleSheets** pane includes the style sheet of the background parent UXML Document in a read-only state. This is because the style sheets are still being applied to the **Template Instance**:   Open Instance in Isolation example
- **Open Instance in Context**: Keep the current UXML Document loaded while making all its elements read-only and appear dimmed in the **Hierarchy** and the **Canvas**. You can edit the contents of the **Template Instance** within the context of the parent UXML Document. Use this option to update **Template Instance** content without losing the context of the host document:   Open Instance in Context example
- **Show in Project**: Show the location of the **Template Instance** file in the **Project window**.

For the second and third options, a breadcrumb appears above the ****Viewport****. You can use the breadcrumb to go back to a parent UXML Document.

## Unpack a UXML document template instance

To unpack a single **Template Instance**, right-click on a **Template Instance** and select **Unpack Instance**. This changes **Template Instance** to a normal UXML Document.

To unpack all the **Template Instances**, right-click on a **Template Instance** and select **Unpack Instance Completely**. This changes all the **Template Instances** to normal UXML Documents.
