# Navigation panel reference

Use the Package Manager’s navigation panel to select which subset of packages you want to view.

Select a context from the navigation panel **(A)** to list those types of packages in the list panel **(B)**. When you select a package from the list panel, its details display in the details view **(C)**.

## Context list

Select the context you want from the navigation panel. You can select from these options:

| **Context** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **All Packages** | Displays all **feature sets** and packages installed in your project, including local, git, and embedded packages, and packages installed from any registry. The list also includes any packages from the **Asset Store** that you added from the **My Assets** context. |
| **Updates** | Lists all packages in your project that you can update, including Asset Store packages. Appears only when packages are available to update. |
| **Errors and Warnings** | Lists all packages in your project that require attention. Appears only when packages have errors or warnings. |
| **Unity Registry** | Displays all feature sets and packages on the Unity package registry, regardless of whether they’re already installed in your project. This doesn’t include packages installed from any other location or from any scoped registry. |
| **My Assets** | Displays all Asset Store packages that you have purchased using the Unity ID you’re currently logged in with. |
| **Built-in** | Displays only built-in Unity packages, which represent core Unity features. You can use these packages to turn Unity modules on and off.  **Tip**: You can find out more about what each built-in package (module) implements in the Unity Scripting API. Each module assembly page lists which APIs the built-in package implements. |
| **Services** | Displays integrated services to help you to engage, retain, and monetize audiences. |
| **My Registries** | Displays any packages available from any scoped registry installed in this project.  This context appears only if you installed a scoped registry in this project.  If you installed a scoped registry but it’s not listed in the **My Registries** context or the **My Registries** context isn’t available at all, it might be because the package registry server you added doesn’t implement either of the `/-/v1/search` or `/-/all` endpoints, which means that it’s not compatible with Unity’s Package Manager. |

**Note**: If you entered text in the search box or set filters, the list panel displays only feature sets and packages which match the context, search criteria, and active filters.
