# Apply masking effects in UI Toolkit

Masking is a technique that lets you control which parts of a UI element are visible. In UI Toolkit, you can use USS property `overflow: hidden` to hide parts of a UI element that are outside the bounds of another UI element.

## Masking with an element

You can use an element to mask another element. To make a masking effect with an element, add the masking element as the parent element of the masked element. Set the `overflow` property to `hidden` on the masking element. This hides the parts of the masked element that are outside the bounds of the masking element.

The following example shows how to make a masking effect with a rectangle shape and a rounded corner shape.

In the example, the `#MaskSquare` and `MaskRounded` elements are the masking elements, and the `Logo1` and `Logo2` elements are the masked elements. The masking elements are the parent elements of the masked elements. The example uses a `VisualElement` with a background image to demonstrate the masking effect. You can apply the masking technique to any element, such as a Label or a Button.

The `#MaskRounded` element has a `border-radius` property set to `50px`. This creates a rounded corner masking effect.

The UXML looks like this:

```
<UXML>
    <VisualElement name="MaskSquare" >
        <VisualElement name="Logo1" />
    </VisualElement>
    <VisualElement name="MaskRounded" >
        <VisualElement name="Logo2"  />
    </VisualElement>
</UXML>
```

The USS looks like this:

```
#MaskSquare {
    overflow: hidden;
}

#MaskRounded {
    overflow: hidden;
    border-radius: 50px;
}

#Logo1, #Logo2 {
    background-image: url("unity-logo.png");
}
```

## Masking with arbitrary shapes

To make a masking effect with an arbitrary shape, set an SVG as the background image of the masking element as shown in the following example:

For information on how to use an SVG image as a background image, refer to Set background images.

**Note**: Arbitrary shape masking is currently not supported in World Space UI.

The UXML looks like this:

```
<UXML>
    <VisualElement name="MaskSVG" >
        <VisualElement name="Logo3" />
    </VisualElement>
</UXML>
```

The USS looks like this:

```
#MaskSVG {
    overflow: hidden;
    background-image: url("mask.svg");
}   

#Logo3 {
    background-image: url("unity-logo.png");
}
```

## Reduce batch breaks for nested masking

Nested masking occurs when both an element and one or more ancestors define a mask. The intersection of these masks defines the final visibility. You can use this technique to create intricate visual effects or selectively reveal parts of an image based on various criteria. For example, you can define masks to display certain regions of an element and hide other masked areas.

When masking with rectangle shapes, Unity uses axis-aligned rectangles as the clipping region, this is called rectangle clipping. When masking with rounded corners or arbitrary shapes, Unity uses stencil masking instead of rectangle clipping. Stencil masking stores masks in a stencil, which is a special image type with 8 bits per channel. The shape stored in the stencil defines the clipping region. For more information, refer to ShaderLab command: Stencil.

Stencil masking uses a GPU feature called a **stencil buffer** for masking operations. The stencil has a GPU-associated state that dictates image modification and its impact on rendering. When elements share the same stencil state, they can be batched into a single draw call. However, any change in the stencil state, such as nested masking, results in batching breaking. Batch breaking can significantly impact performance as it prevents multiple elements from being efficiently rendered together in a single draw call. It’s crucial to minimize batch breaking to optimize rendering performance.

To reduce the number of batch breaks for nested stencil masking, consider applying `UsageHints.MaskContainer` on the masking element that’s the ancestor of all the masks.

The following illustration shows the number of batches in a single-level masking, a nested masking, and a nested masking with `MaskContainer` applied. The yellow color indicates the masking elements. The orange color indicates the masking element with `MaskContainer` applied. The numbers indicate the number of batches.

A: Single-level masking (1 batch) 
 B: Nested masking (5 batches) 
 C: Nested masking with MaskContainer (2 batches)

**Note**: If you see a warning message “Depth and stencil buffers are disabled in **Player settings**. Depending on the platform and Graphics API in use, UI elements might not render correctly.”, it means that UI Toolkit requires depth and stencil buffers to properly support masking and nesting.

To fix this, go to **Player Settings** and enable **Depth and Stencil Buffers**. This ensures UI elements render correctly across all platforms and graphics APIs.
