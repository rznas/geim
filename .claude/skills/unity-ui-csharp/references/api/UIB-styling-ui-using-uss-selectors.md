# Style UI with UI Builder

In UI Builder, you can style an element with inline styles or USS selectors. Inline styles are typically used for single-use or experimental purposes, whereas managing styles through style sheets tends to be easier and more efficient. You can extract inline styles to a USS class. You can also manage style sheets and USS selectors in UI Builder.

## Set inline styles to elements

You can set inline styles to elements in the **Inlined Styles** section in the element’s **Inspector** window.

Style fields that appear **bold** with a solid line on the left of the field label represent style properties that are already set or **overridden**. It’s important to keep track of these **overridden** style properties, as they always override the same property coming from a StyleSheet or from a C# default. To unset or remove the **override** for a style property, right-click on the style field and select **Unset**.

**Note**: You can’t use inline style to style pseudo-classes or read-only elements.

## Manage a style sheet

To add a style sheet, use the **+** dropdown menu and select one of the following options:

- **Create New USS**: This opens a **Save File Dialog** to create a new style sheet in your project.
- **Add Existing USS**: This opens the **Open File Dialog** to add an existing style sheet to the UI Document.

To remove a style sheet from the active UI Document, right-click on the style sheet and select **Remove USS**.

To make a style sheet active, right-click on a style sheet and select **Set as Active USS**. An **Active StyleSheet** appears bold.

When you edit sub-documents, the style sheets that belong to parent documents appear dimmed and are read-only.

**Note**: You can add comments in a USS file with a text editor the same way as you do with a CSS file. However, if you open the USS file in the UI Builder, the comments are removed as soon as you save the USS file from the UI Builder.

## Create USS selectors

You can create any new USS selectors in the StyleSheets window. You can also create a new class selector in the **StyleSheets** section in the Inspector window. A new selector is always added to the **Active StyleSheet**.

To create a new selector in the StyleSheets window:

1. In the StyleSheets window, click in the **Add new selector…** field. This opens a USS selector syntax reference window on top of the ****Viewport**** as shown in the image below:   USS Selector cheatsheet
2. Enter the selector with the correct syntax. For example, a class selector should start with `.`.
3. Press the Enter key.
4. In the StyleSheets window, select the newly-created selector.
5. In the selector’s Inspector window, set the desired styles for the selector.

To create a new class selector in an element’s Inspector window:

1. In the Hierarchy window, select the element.
2. In the Inspector window, enter the class selector in the **Style Class List** text field.
3. Select **Add Style Class to List**. A yellow-style class label appears in **Style Class List**.    StyleSheet section of Inspector
4. If the yellow-style class label appears faded, it means the selector doesn’t exist in the attached StyleSheets. You can double-click on it to create a new class selector. If the class selector exists, you can double-click on it to open the selector’s Inspector window.

## Manipulate USS selectors

To copy, paste, duplicate, rename, or delete one or more USS selectors:

1. In the StyleSheets window, select the group.
2. Right-click the group and select the desired action.

**Tip**: You can copy and paste a USS selector between the UI Builder’s StyleSheets window and a text editor.

## Match USS style class to elements

You can match USS classes to elements. For example, if you have the following USS style:

To match USS style class to elements, do any of the following:

- Drag a style class label, like , onto the element in either the **Hierarchy** or the **Canvas**.
- Enter the name of the selector into the **StyleSheet** > **Style Class List** field in the element’s Inspector window and then select **Add Style Class to List**:
