# USS properties reference

The following table lists the USS properties in UI Toolkit.

The table indicates which properties are inherited and their animatability. For an inherited property, the element gets the value from its parent element if you don’t specify a value for it. The following example uses an inherited property to set the font for all elements.

```
:root {
    -unity-font: resource("Font/consola.ttf");
}
```

Click the property name to see detailed information about that property.

**Note**: The usage of a USS property that’s the same as the CSS property links to the Mozilla developer documentation.
