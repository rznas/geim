# Load a keystore

This page explains how to load an existing keystore and select a key from it to use as the project key.

This is relevant if you want to publish your application, because you must provide a key from a keystore when you sign the application.

To load an existing keystore:

1. Open Android Publishing Settings.
2. Under the **Project Keystore** heading, enable **Custom Keystore**.
3. Click the drop-down below **Custom Keystore**.
4. Select **Browse** to load a keystore from your file system, or select a keystore from below the partition in the UI. The keystores below the partition are those stored in the keystores dedicated location. For more information, see Choose the keystore location.
5. Enter the password for the keystore in the **Keystore password** property field. If the password is correct, Unity loads the keystore.

After you load a keystore into your project, select a key from the keystore to use as the key alias. To do this:

1. Use the dropdown list in **Key alias** to select the key you want to use.
2. In the **Key password** property field, enter the password for the key.
