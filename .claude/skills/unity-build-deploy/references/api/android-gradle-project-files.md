# Gradle project files

Gradle project files configure different aspects of your application, such as the modules to include and how to build them.

The following table lists the **Gradle** project files that exist for Unity projects and describes the purpose of each one.

| **Gradle project file** | **Purpose** |
| --- | --- |
| **Main Manifest** | Contains important metadata about your Android application. For more information, refer to Unity Library Manifest. |
| **Unity Launcher Manifest** | Contains important metadata about your Android application’s launcher. For more information, refer to Unity Launcher Manifest. |
| **Main Gradle** | Contains information on how to build your Android application as a library. |
| **Launcher Gradle** | Contains instructions on how to build your Android application. |
| **Base Gradle** | Contains configuration that’s shared between all other templates and Gradle projects. |
| **Gradle Properties** | Contains configuration settings for the Gradle build environment. This includes:  The JVM (Java Virtual Machine) memory configuration.  A property to allow Gradle to build using multiple JVMs. A property for choosing the tool to do the minification. A property to not compress native libs when building an app bundle. |
| **Gradle Settings** | Contains declaration of artifact repositories to resolve external dependencies required for your application. |
| **Proguard** | Contains configuration settings for the minification process.   **Note:** If minification removes necessary Java code, add a rule in this file to keep that code. |
