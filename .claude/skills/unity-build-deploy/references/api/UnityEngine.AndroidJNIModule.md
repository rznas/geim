### Classes

| Class | Description |
| --- | --- |
| AndroidApplication | Use this class to access the runtime data of your Android application. |
| AndroidAssetPackInfo | Represents the download progress of a single Android asset pack. |
| AndroidAssetPacks | Provides methods for handling Android asset packs. |
| AndroidAssetPackState | Represents the state of a single Android asset pack. |
| AndroidAssetPackUseMobileDataRequestResult | Represents the choice of an end user that indicates if your application can use mobile data to download Android asset packs. |
| AndroidConfiguration | Use this class to retrieve device specific configuration information. |
| AndroidDevice | Interface into Android specific functionality. |
| AndroidGame | Provides methods and properties for accessing different Android game APIs. |
| AndroidJavaClass | AndroidJavaClass is the Unity representation of a generic instance of java.lang.Class. |
| AndroidJavaObject | AndroidJavaObject is the Unity representation of a generic instance of java.lang.Object. |
| AndroidJavaProxy | This class can be used to implement any java interface. Any java vm method invocation matching the interface on the proxy object will automatically be passed to the c# implementation. |
| AndroidJNI | 'Raw' JNI interface to Android Java VM from Unity scripting (C#).Note: Using raw JNI functions requires advanced knowledge of the Android Java Native Interface (JNI). Please take note. |
| AndroidJNIHelper | Helper interface for JNI interaction; signature creation and method lookups.Note: Using raw JNI functions requires advanced knowledge of the Android Java Native Interface (JNI). Please take note. |
| AndroidLocale | Use this class to retrieve the language and region preferences set on the device. |
| ApplicationExitInfoProvider | Access point to get the list of ApplicationExitInfo records with the reasons for the most recent application terminations. |
| DiagnosticsReporting | Class with options for reporting diagnostics information to the Android system. |
| DownloadAssetPackAsyncOperation | Represents an asynchronous Android asset pack download operation. AndroidAssetPacks.DownloadAssetPackAsync returns an instance of this class. |
| GetAssetPackStateAsyncOperation | Represents an asynchronous Android asset pack state request operation. AndroidAssetPacks.GetAssetPackStateAsync returns an instance of this class. |
| PermissionCallbacks | Contains callbacks invoked when permission request is executed using Permission.RequestUserPermission. |
| RequestToUseMobileDataAsyncOperation | Represents an asynchronous operation that requests to use mobile data to download Android asset packs. |

### Structs

| Struct | Description |
| --- | --- |
| JNINativeMethod | Defines a single method to register with a Java class using AndroidJNI.RegisterNatives. |
| Permission | Structure describing a permission that requires user authorization. |

### Enumerations

| Enumeration | Description |
| --- | --- |
| AndroidAssetPackError | Values that indicate the type of Android asset pack error when the status is either AndroidAssetPackStatus.Failed or AndroidAssetPackStatus.Unknown. |
| AndroidAssetPackStatus | Values that indicate the status of an Android asset pack. |
| AndroidColorModeHdr | Options to indicate whether the screen can display a wide range brightness levels. |
| AndroidColorModeWideColorGamut | Options to indicate whether the screen can display wide range of color gamut or not. |
| AndroidGameMode | Options for the available game modes that AndroidGame.GameMode can return. |
| AndroidGameState | Options for the available game states that you can pass to AndroidGame.SetGameState or you can set as a current game state mode to be used for Automated game state hinting in Unity using AndroidGame.Automatic.SetGameState method. |
| AndroidHardwareKeyboardHidden | Options to indicate whether the physical keyboard is available. |
| AndroidHardwareType | AndroidHardwareType describes the type of Android device on which the app is running. |
| AndroidKeyboard | Options to indicate the type of keyboard the device is using. |
| AndroidKeyboardHidden | Options to indicate whether any keyboard is available for use on the device. |
| AndroidNavigation | Options to indicate the type of navigation methods used on the device. |
| AndroidNavigationHidden | Options to indicate whether the 5-way or DPAD navigation methods are available on the device. |
| AndroidOrientation | Options to indicate the orientation of the screen. |
| AndroidScreenLayoutDirection | Options to indicate the screen layout direction. |
| AndroidScreenLayoutLong | Options to indicate whether the aspect ratio of the screen is taller or wider than normal. |
| AndroidScreenLayoutRound | Options to indicate whether the screen shape is rounded or not. |
| AndroidScreenLayoutSize | Options to indicate the size of the device screen. |
| AndroidTouchScreen | Options to indicate whether the device supports touchscreen. |
| AndroidUIModeNight | Options to indicate whether the device screen is in a special mode, such as a night mode. |
| AndroidUIModeType | Options to indicate the user interface mode of the device. |
| ExitReason | The reason code for termination of the process. |
| ProcessImportance | Indicates the relative importance level that the system assigns to the process. These levels are represented by constants. The constants are numbered in such a way that more important values are always smaller than the less important values. |
