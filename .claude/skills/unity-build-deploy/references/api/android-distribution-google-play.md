# Google Play delivery requirements

Google Play has specific requirements that an application must meet before you publish it. Familiarize yourself with these requirements and understand how to fulfill them before you publish an application to Google Play.

For information on how to publish your application on Google Play, refer to [Google Play](https://developer.android.com/distribute/google-play).

### Android App Bundle

Google Play requires new applications to be an [Android App Bundle](https://developer.android.com/guide/app-bundle) (AAB) instead of an **APK**. For information on why, refer to The future of Android App Bundles is here (Android developer blog).

To configure an application to be an AAB:

1. Open the **Build Profiles** window (menu: **File** > **Build Profiles**).
2. From the list of platforms in the **Platforms** panel, select **Android**.
3. Select Player Settings for Android.
4. In the **Publishing Settings** section, enable **Split Application Binary**.
5. On the **Build Profiles** window, under **Platform Settings** section, enable **Build App Bundle (Google Play)**. If you want to export the project and build it in Android Studio, enable **Export Project** then enable **Export for App Bundle**.  **Notes**:
  - **Build App Bundle (Google Play)** setting is visible only if you disable **Export Project** setting.
  - Make sure ****Development Build**** setting is disabled as otherwise the application upload might fail.

When you Build the application, Unity builds the application as an AAB.

### Application size

Google Play limits the install size of applications. The following table describes the size limitations Google Play has for each application type:

| **Application type** | **Size limitation** |
| --- | --- |
| **APK** | If you split the application binary or use a custom expansion file, the APK must be smaller than 100 MB and the expansion file must be smaller than 2 GB. Otherwise, the APK must be smaller than 100 MB. |
| **AAB** | If you split the application binary or use custom asset packs, the base module inside the AAB must be smaller than 200 MB and the asset packs must fit the file sizes described in the [Google Play maximum size limits](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9859372#size_limits) documentation. Otherwise, the AAB must be smaller than 200 MB. |

For information on how to optimize the install size of your application, refer to Optimize distribution size.

### Symbols file size

Google Play limits the size of the symbols package or the embedded symbols within an Android App Bundle. The symbols files might be rejected if their file size exceeds this limit. Unity displays a warning if your symbols package exceeds the size limit specified in the **Symbols size threshold** in the Android Player settings > **Other Settings** > **Configuration**.

### Texture **compression** targeting

[Texture compression targeting](https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/asset-delivery/texture-compression) is a feature of Android App Bundles that helps Google Play to generate and serve optimized APKs for different devices. If you enable it, Unity includes texture assets formatted with different compression formats in any Android App Bundles that it builds. When a device installs the application from Google Play, the APKs that the device receives contain texture assets that use the optimal **texture compression** format for the device.

Texture compression targeting also automatically enables the split application binary feature and generates an install-time asset pack called **UnityTextureCompressionsAssetPack**. This asset pack contains common resources and assets required by the first **scene**. When you disable texture compression targeting, Unity packs these assets into the base module. This means that enabling texture compression targeting reduces the size of the base module. This can be important because the base module has a size limit of 200 MB. For more information on how Unity configures asset packs, refer to Asset packs in Unity.

To enable texture compression targeting:

1. Enable Android App Bundles.
2. Open the Build Profiles window.
3. Select Player Settings for the Android platform.
4. In the **Other Settings** > **Rendering** section, find **Texture Compression Formats** and add all required texture compression formats to it. The first texture compression format in this list is the [default format](https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/asset-delivery/texture-compression#select-default-format).
**Note**: You can also use the `PlayerSettings.Android.textureCompressionFormats` API to assign the required texture compression formats.
5. On the **Build Profiles** window, select **Asset Import Overrides** and set **Texture Compression** to a value other than **Force Uncompressed**.

**Note**: When Texture compression targeting is enabled, Unity disables and ignores the **Texture Compression** Android build setting which means you can’t use this setting to override the texture compression format for a build.

If you don’t enable Android App Bundles and export or build your application as an APK, Unity only uses the first texture compression format in the **Texture Compression Formats** list.

If you want some texture assets to use specific texture compression formats, you can override their texture compression format. The value you set for an individual **texture overrides** the default texture compression format and the optimal format that Google Play would select for specific target devices. For information on how to change the **texture format** of individual textures, refer to the documentation on Texture Import Settings window reference.

### 64-bit Architecture

Google Play requires applications to support 64-bit architecture. For more information, refer to [Support 64-bit architectures](https://developer.android.com/distribute/best-practices/develop/64-bit).

To make your application support 64-bit architecture, follow these steps:

1. Open the **Build Profiles** window (menu: **File** > **Build Profiles**).
2. From the list of platforms in the **Platforms** panel, select **Android** or create a build profile for the **Android** platform.
3. Select Player Settings.
4. In the **Other Settings** > **Configuration** section, enable **ARM64**. 
**Note**: You can enable this setting only if you set your project’s Scripting back end to IL2CPP.

### Target API

Google Play requires applications to support a minimum target API. For information on what the current minimum target API is, refer to [Meet Google Play’s target API level requirement](https://developer.android.com/distribute/best-practices/develop/target-sdk).

To change your application’s target API:

1. Open **Build Profiles** window (menu: **File** > **Build Profiles**).
2. From the list of platforms in the **Platforms** pane, select **Android**.
3. Select Player Settings.
4. In the **Other Settings** > **Identification** section, set **Target API Level** to at least the target API level that Google Play requires.

### Report application dependencies

Google Play can check the Package Manager and **Asset Store** packages that your application uses for known certification failures. It does this automatically after you upload your application to the Play Store and before the main certification process begins. This helps to identify issues with your application’s dependencies quickly without running the full certification process. If Google Play finds issues, it reports them to you via the Play Store Console along with details about the issues and how you can fix them before you submit the application again.

To report dependencies, follow these steps:

1. Open **Build Profiles** window (menu: **File** > **Build Profiles**).
2. From the list of platforms in the **Platforms** pane, select **Android**.
3. Select Player Settings.
4. In the **Publishing Settings** section, enable **Report Dependencies in App Bundle** to enable collection and reporting of dependencies to Google Play.

### App signature

Google Play requires applications to be signed. For information on how to sign your application, refer to Android Keystore Manager.
