# Create a new keystore

This page explains how to use the Keystore Manager window to create a new keystore.

This is relevant if you want to publish your application, because you must provide a key from a keystore when you sign the application.

To create a new keystore:

1. Open the Keystore Manager window.
2. In the top-left of the window, select **Keystore** > **Create New**.
3. Select **Anywhere** and save the keystore file in your Project folder, or select **In Dedicated Location** and save the keystore to a different directory on your computer. For more information, see Choose the keystore location.
4. Enter a password for the keystore in the **Password** field and re-enter the password in the **Confirm password** field.
5. A keystore must contain at least one key so to finish creating a keystore, add a key. To do this, see Add keys to a keystore.

## Choose the keystore location

You can create a new keystore anywhere on your computer, however there are two special locations: the Project folder and what is called the keystores dedicated location. If you place a keystore in either of these places, Unity saves a relative path to the keystore. Otherwise Unity saves an absolute path to the keystore. Under the **Keystore** > **Create New** menu option, there are two options:

- **Anywhere** opens the file explorer at the root of your project folder. This is the default place that Unity stores keystores.
- **In Dedicated Location** opens the file explorer in a custom location. By default, this path points to `$HOME/` on MacOS and to `%USER_HOME%\` on Windows. To change the dedicated location for your computer, go to **Edit** > **Preferences** (macOS: **Unity > Settings**) and then navigate to **External Tools** > **Android** > **Keystores Dedicated Location**. Select **Browse** to choose a location or enter a path in the text box.

If you store a keystore in a dedicated location, Unity saves a relative path from the dedicated location to the keystore. This means different computers can specify a different dedicated location and store the keystore in a different place.

**Note**: If you save the new keystore outside of your Project folder or a shared directory, collaborators on your project might not have access to it.
