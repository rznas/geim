# Android keystores

A keystore is a binary file that contains private keys and public key certificates. Android uses the keys in a keystore to sign an application for security reasons. For more information, see [Keystores, keys, and certificates](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing#certificates-keystores).

## Android keystores in Unity

To interface with keystores, Unity provides the Keystore Manager and properties in **Player Settings**. You can use these tools to create, configure, or load **Android keystores** and keys.

**Note**: If you sign an application with a particular key and upload the application to an app store, you must sign future versions of the application with the same key.

| **Topic** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
