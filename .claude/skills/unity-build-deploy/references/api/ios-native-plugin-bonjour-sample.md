# Bonjour browser sample

For a simple example of how to use a native **plug-in**, download the Bonjour Browser Sample.

This example demonstrates how you can invoke Objective-C code from a Unity iOS application. This application implements a simple Bonjour client and consists of:

- A Unity iOS Project where `Plugins\Bonjour.cs` is the C# interface to the native code, and `BonjourTest.cs` is the script that implements the application logic.
- Native code (located in `Assets/Plugins/iOS`) that will be added to the built Xcode project as described in Automated plug-in integration.
