# Encryption export regulations

When publishing to the App Store, you must declare if your application uses encryption in order to comply with U.S. export regulations.

To make a declaration, you must add the [ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information-property-list/itsappusesnonexemptencryption) key in your applications [Information Property List](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list) file. If your application doesn’t use encryption, or uses encryption that’s exempt from U.S. export compliance, set [ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information-property-list/itsappusesnonexemptencryption) to false.

The Unity Editor with Apple Platform support, in its base configuration without any additional packages, **plug-ins**, or extensions, doesn’t use non-exempt encryption. It’s your responsibility to verify that any third-party components and plug-ins included in your Unity project comply with encryption export regulations.

To streamline the submission process, add the `ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption` key to your `Info.plist` file. Without this key, App Store Connect prompts you to complete an export compliance questionnaire every time you upload a new version of your application.

For more information, refer to [Complying with Encryption Export Regulations](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/complying-with-encryption-export-regulations).

**Note**: `UnityWebRequest` uses [NSURLSession](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsurlsession) which is exempt from export compliance.

## Packages

The [Unity Mobile Notifications](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.mobile.notifications@latest) package is built on top of Apple’s notification API. Any networking for notifications is handled by the operating system, not the application, and is therefore exempt.
