# SpeedTree Import Settings

When you put SpeedTree files in the Assets folder of your Unity project, the Unity Editor automatically imports and stores them as Unity assets.

SpeedTree import settings are specific to files for models created in SpeedTree. For information on models and animation created in other 3D modeling applications, refer to the Model Import Settings window.

## Importing SpeedTree files to Unity

Unity recognizes and imports SpeedTree model assets in the same way it handles other assets. If you’re using SpeedTree Modeler 7, re-save your .spm files using the Unity version of the Modeler. If you’re using SpeedTree Modeler 8, 9, or 10, you can save your .st or .st9 files directly into the Unity project folder.

The SpeedTree Importer generates a **prefab** with the LOD Group component configured. You can instantiate the prefab in a **scene** as a common prefab instance, or select the prefab as a tree prototype and then paint it across the **terrain**.

### Wind settings

When you import an .st9 file to the Unity Editor, you can select the correct Wind algorithm to use for the new Unity asset.

### Materials

By default, Unity imports SpeedTree model materials as sub-assets. If you want to make adjustments to the materials, you can extract them to a location of your choice or re-use existing materials with Material Remapping.

## SpeedTree Import window

You can customize import settings from the SpeedTree Import window:

### View import settings

To view the import settings in the ****Inspector**** window, select the file in the **Project** window.

### Customize how Unity imports the file

To customize how Unity imports the selected file, use the properties on the **Model**, **Materials**, and **Wind** tabs on this window.

For more information about settings you can use to customize how Unity imports a SpeedTree model, see the following topics:

| **Topic** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Model tab** | Understand the options in the Model tab of the SpeedTree Import Settings window. |
| **Materials tab** | Understand the options in the Materials tab of the SpeedTree Import Settings window. |
