# Import an Android Library plug-in

You can import an Android Library plug-in created outside of Unity into your Unity project using the following steps:

1. Copy the Android Library **plug-in** to the **Assets** folder of your Unity Project.
2. If the Android Library plug-in root folder doesn’t use the `.androidlib` extension, add this extension to the folder. For example, `mylibrary.androidlib`.

Unity now supports the Android Library plug-in and includes it in the final project that Gradle uses to build your application. For more information, refer to How Unity builds Android applications.

## Configure an Android Library plug-in

Android Library plug-in is a dependency of a built-in module **unityLibrary**. You can change this default behavior. For example, you can configure an Android Library plug-in to depend on **unityLibrary** instead. To do this, use the following steps:

1. In the **Project** window, select the `.androidlib` plug-in to access the ****Inspector**** window.
2. In the **Select dependent module** section, select **None**.   Android Library plug-in Inspector with the Select dependent module setting selected.
3. Add the following code in your plug-in’s build gradle **dependencies** scope: `dependencies { ... implementation project(':unityLibrary') implementation fileTree(dir: project(':unityLibrary').getProjectDir().toString() + ('\\libs'), include: ['*.jar']) }`

You also have the option to include Android Library plug-in as a dependency of the **launcher** or both **unityLibrary** and **launcher** built-in modules.
