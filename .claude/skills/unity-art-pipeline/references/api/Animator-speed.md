### Description

The playback speed of the Animator. 1 is normal playback speed.

Use Animator.speed to manipulate the playback speed of the Animator. Any animations currently being played by the Animator are slowed down or sped up depending on how the speed is altered. Set speed to 1 for normal playback. Negative playback speed is only supported when the recorder is enabled. For more details refer to Animator.recorderMode.

```csharp
using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;public class Example : MonoBehaviour
{
    Animator m_Animator;
    //Value from the slider, and it converts to speed level
    float m_MySliderValue;    void Start()
    {
        //Get the animator, attached to the GameObject you are intending to animate.
        m_Animator = gameObject.GetComponent<Animator>();
    }    void OnGUI()
    {
        //Create a Label in Game view for the Slider
        GUI.Label(new Rect(0, 25, 40, 60), "Speed");
        //Create a horizontal Slider to control the speed of the Animator. Drag the slider to 1 for normal speed.        m_MySliderValue = GUI.HorizontalSlider(new Rect(45, 25, 200, 60), m_MySliderValue, 0.0F, 1.0F);
        //Make the speed of the Animator match the Slider value
        m_Animator.speed = m_MySliderValue;
    }
}
```
