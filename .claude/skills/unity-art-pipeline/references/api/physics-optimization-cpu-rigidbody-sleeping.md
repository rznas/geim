# Use Rigidbody sleeping to improve physics performance

Reduce CPU load and improve physics performance by enabling **Rigidbody** sleeping for stationary objects.

Rigidbody sleeping can drastically reduce CPU load, especially in **scenes** with many physical objects that are often stationary or frequently come to rest. When a **Rigidbody** component moves at a slower speed than the **Sleep Threshold**, the physics system sets the **Rigidbody** component to a sleeping state. When a **Rigidbody** component is asleep, the physics system doesn’t include it in physics calculations. When a sleeping **Rigidbody** component receives a **collision** or force, the physics system wakes up the Rigidbody component and includes it in physics calculations.

In script, control Rigidbody sleeping with `Rigidbody.Sleep` and `Rigidbody.WakeUp`

Rigidbody sleeping is highly effective in environments with many interactive props, destructible elements that settle, or physics-based puzzles that stabilize. While scenes with constant high-velocity motion benefit less, enabling sleeping is generally a good default behavior.

To enable Rigidbody sleeping, the recommended best practices are:

- Ensure that the **Rigidbody** component’s sleep threshold is set appropriately. Set the **Sleep Threshold** in the Physics Project Settings and in script with `Rigidbody.sleepThreshold`.
- Avoid calling `Rigidbody.WakeUp` unnecessarily on objects unless they need to be active in the simulation. Continuously waking objects negates the benefit of sleeping.
- Check if a **Rigidbody** component is sleeping with `Rigidbody.IsSleeping`.
- Use the Physics Debugger (**Window > Analysis > Physics Debugger**) to visually inspect the sleep state of **Rigidbody** components in your scene. The Physics Debugger can help identify objects that are unexpectedly active and not sleeping, potentially due to persistent small contacts or incorrect sleep settings.
