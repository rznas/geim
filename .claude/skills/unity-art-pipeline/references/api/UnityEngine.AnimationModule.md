### Description

The Animation module implements Unity's animation system.

### Classes

| Class | Description |
| --- | --- |
| AimConstraint | Constrains the orientation of a GameObject based on the position of one or more sources. |
| Animation | The animation component is used to play back animations. |
| AnimationClip | Provides an asset that assigns animation curves to animatable properties. |
| AnimationEvent | AnimationEvent lets you call a script function similar to SendMessage as part of playing back an animation. |
| AnimationPlayableBinding | A PlayableBinding that contains information representing an AnimationPlayableOutput. |
| AnimationPlayableOutputExtensions | Static class providing experimental extension methods for AnimationPlayableOutput . |
| AnimationPlayableUtilities | Implements high-level utility methods to simplify use of the Playable API with Animations. |
| AnimationSceneHandleUtility | Static class providing utility functions for animation scene handles. |
| AnimationState | The AnimationState gives full control over animation blending. |
| AnimationStreamHandleUtility | Static class providing utility functions for animation stream handles. |
| Animator | Manages, controls, and evaluates the animation of a GameObject. |
| AnimatorControllerParameter | Used to communicate between scripting and an AnimatorController. |
| AnimatorJobExtensions | Static class providing extension methods for Animator and the animation C# jobs. |
| AnimatorOverrideController | Interface to control Animator Override Controller. |
| AnimatorUtility | Various utilities for animator manipulation. |
| Avatar | The avatar asset describes the mapping of the character in the Animator. |
| AvatarBuilder | Class to build avatars from user scripts. |
| AvatarMask | AvatarMask is used to mask out humanoid body parts and transforms. |
| DiscreteEvaluationAttribute | Use this attribute to indicate that a property will be evaluated as a discrete value during animation playback. |
| GenericBindingUtility | Animation utility functions for reading and writing values from Unity components. |
| HumanPoseHandler | Use this class to create, read, and write the HumanPose for a humanoid avatar skeleton hierarchy or an avatar pose. |
| HumanTrait | Details of all the human bone and muscle types defined by Mecanim. |
| LookAtConstraint | Constrains the orientation of a GameObject based on the position of one or more sources. |
| Motion | Stores a reference to an animation asset associated with a State Machine state. |
| NotKeyableAttribute | Use this attribute in a script to mark a property as non-animatable. |
| ParentConstraint | Constrains the transformation of a GameObject based on the position and rotation of one or more sources. |
| PositionConstraint | Constrains the position of a GameObject based on the position of one or more sources. |
| RotationConstraint | Constrains the rotation of a GameObject based on the rotation of one or more sources. |
| RuntimeAnimatorController | A representation of the Animator Controller, optimized for runtime. |
| ScaleConstraint | Constrains the scale of a GameObject based on the scale of one or more sources. |
| SharedBetweenAnimatorsAttribute | The SharedBetweenAnimatorsAttribute specifies that this StateMachineBehaviour is instantiated only once and shared by all Animator instances. This attribute reduces the memory footprint for each controller instance. |
| StateMachineBehaviour | StateMachineBehaviour is a component that you add to a state machine state. It is the base class that a script must derive from. |

### Structs

| Struct | Description |
| --- | --- |
| AnimationClipPlayable | A Playable that controls an AnimationClip. |
| AnimationHumanStream | The humanoid stream of animation data passed from one Playable to another. |
| AnimationLayerMixerPlayable | An implementation of IPlayable that controls an animation layer mixer. |
| AnimationMixerPlayable | An implementation of IPlayable that controls an animation mixer. |
| AnimationPlayableOutput | A IPlayableOutput implementation that connects the PlayableGraph to an Animator in the Scene. |
| AnimationScriptPlayable | A Playable that can run a custom, multi-threaded animation job. |
| AnimationStream | The stream of animation data passed from one Playable to another. |
| AnimatorClipInfo | Information about clip being played and blended by the Animator. |
| AnimatorControllerPlayable | An implementation of IPlayable that controls an animation RuntimeAnimatorController. |
| AnimatorStateInfo | Runtime information on the current or next animation state, managed by an Animator. |
| AnimatorTransitionInfo | Information about the current transition on a specific state machine layer. |
| BoundProperty | A BoundProperty is a safe handle to read and write value in a generic way from any Unity components. |
| ConstraintSource | Represents a weighted position that can be used in a constraint. |
| GenericBinding | Defines an animatable property on a Unity Component. |
| HumanBone | The mapping between a bone in the model and the conceptual bone in the Mecanim human anatomy. |
| HumanDescription | Class that holds humanoid avatar parameters to pass to the AvatarBuilder.BuildHumanAvatar function. |
| HumanLimit | This class stores the rotation limits that define the muscle for a single human bone. |
| HumanPose | Retargetable humanoid pose. |
| MatchTargetWeightMask | Use this struct to specify the position and rotation weight mask for Animator.MatchTarget. |
| MuscleHandle | Handle for a muscle in the AnimationHumanStream. |
| PropertySceneHandle | Handle to read a Component property on an object in the Scene. |
| PropertyStreamHandle | Handle for a Component property on an object in the AnimationStream. |
| SkeletonBone | Details of the Transform name mapped to the skeleton bone of a model and its default position and rotation in the T-pose. |
| TransformSceneHandle | Handle to read position, rotation and scale of an object in the Scene. |
| TransformStreamHandle | Position, rotation and scale of an object in the AnimationStream. |
