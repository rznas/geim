# State Machine Solo and Mute

In complex **state machines**, it is useful to preview the operation of some parts of the machine separately. For this, you can use the **Mute** and **Solo** functionality:

- **Mute** disables a transition.
- **Solo** plays only that transition.

You can set up multiple **Solo** transitions to play only those that have Solo enabled. If one transition has **Solo** enabled, Unity enables **Mute** on the other transitions. If both **Solo** and **Mute** are enabled, then **Mute** takes precedence.

You can set up **Mute** and **Solo** states either from the **Transition Inspector**, or the **State Inspector**, which provides an overview of all transitions from that state.

In the example above, if you are in `State 0`, only transitions to `State A` and `State B` are available. The muted transitions, `State C` and `State D`, are disabled.

Known issues:

- The Controller graph doesn’t always reflect the internal Mute states of the engine.
