# ScriptPlayable and PlayableBehaviour

Use the `ScriptPlayable<>` object and the `PlayableBehaviour` custom behavior to create custom playables.

To create your own custom playable, inherit from the `PlayableBehaviour` base class:

```
public class MyCustomPlayableBehaviour : PlayableBehaviour
{
    // Implementation of the custom playable behaviour
    // Override PlayableBehaviour methods as needed
}
```

To use a `PlayableBehaviour` as a custom playable, you must wrap it within a `ScriptPlayable<>` object. If you don’t have an instance of your custom playable, use the following code to create a `ScriptPlayable`:

```
ScriptPlayable<MyCustomPlayableBehaviour>.Create(playableGraph);
```

If you have an instance of your custom playable, use the following code to wrap the instance in a `ScriptPlayable<>` object:

```
MyCustomPlayableBehaviour myPlayable = new MyCustomPlayableBehaviour();
ScriptPlayable<MyCustomPlayableBehaviour>.Create(playableGraph, myPlayable);
```

This clones the instance and assigns the clone to the `ScriptPlayable` object. In this example, use the `myPlayable` public property in the **Inspector** window to configure a different behaviour for each instance of your script.

To retrieve the PlayableBehaviour object from the ScriptPlayable object, use the `ScriptPlayable<T> .GetBehaviour()` method.
