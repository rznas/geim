### Description

The HingeJoint groups together 2 rigid bodies, constraining them to move like connected by a hinge.

This joint is great for, well, doors, but can also be used to model chains, etc...

The HingeJoint has a motor which can be used to make the hinge spin around the joints axis. A spring which attempts to reach for a target angle by spinning around the joints axis. And a limit which constrains the joint angle.

### Properties

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| angle | The current angle in degrees of the joint relative to its rest position. (Read Only) |
| extendedLimits | If enabled, the angle of the hinge is extended to [-360, 360] degrees. |
| limits | Limit of angular rotation (in degrees) on the hinge joint. |
| motor | The motor will apply a force up to a maximum force to achieve the target velocity in degrees per second. |
| spring | The spring attempts to reach a target angle by adding spring and damping forces. |
| useAcceleration | Defines whether the HingeJoint.spring outputs accelerations instead of forces. |
| useLimits | Enables the joint's limits. Disabled by default. |
| useMotor | Enables the joint's motor. Disabled by default. |
| useSpring | Enables the joint's spring. Disabled by default. |
| velocity | The angular velocity of the joint in degrees per second. (Read Only) |

### Inherited Members

### Properties

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| gameObject | The game object this component is attached to. A component is always attached to a game object. |
| tag | The tag of this game object. |
| transform | The Transform attached to this GameObject. |
| transformHandle | The TransformHandle of this GameObject. |
| anchor | The Position of the anchor around which the joints motion is constrained. |
| autoConfigureConnectedAnchor | Should the connectedAnchor be calculated automatically? |
| axis | The Direction of the axis around which the body is constrained. |
| breakForce | The force that needs to be applied for this joint to break. |
| breakTorque | The torque that needs to be applied for this joint to break. To be able to break, a joint must be _Locked_ or _Limited_ on the axis of rotation where the torque is being applied. This means that some joints cannot break, such as an unconstrained Configurable Joint. |
| connectedAnchor | Position of the anchor relative to the connected Rigidbody. |
| connectedArticulationBody | A reference to an articulation body this joint connects to. |
| connectedBody | A reference to another rigidbody this joint connects to. |
| connectedMassScale | The scale to apply to the inverse mass and inertia tensor of the connected body prior to solving the constraints. |
| currentForce | The force applied by the solver to satisfy all constraints. |
| currentTorque | The torque applied by the solver to satisfy all constraints. |
| enableCollision | Enable collision between bodies connected with the joint. |
| enablePreprocessing | Toggle preprocessing for this joint. |
| massScale | The scale to apply to the inverse mass and inertia tensor of the body prior to solving the constraints. |
| hideFlags | Should the object be hidden, saved with the Scene or modifiable by the user? |
| name | The name of the object. |
