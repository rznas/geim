# Introduction to character control

The character in a first- or third-person game usually needs some collision-based physics so that it doesn’t fall through the floor or walk through walls. In many applications, the character’s acceleration and movement are intentionally not physically realistic, so that the character can accelerate, brake and change direction almost instantly and without being affected by momentum.

In 3D physics, this type of behaviour can be created using a **Character Controller**. This component gives the character a simple, capsule-shaped **collider** that is always upright. The controller has its own special functions to set the object’s speed and direction but unlike true colliders, a **rigidbody** is not needed and the momentum effects are not realistic.

A character controller cannot walk through static colliders in a **scene**, and so will follow floors and be obstructed by walls. It can push rigidbody objects aside while moving but will not be accelerated by incoming **collisions**. This means that you can use the standard 3D colliders to create a scene around which the controller will walk but you are not limited by realistic physical behaviour on the character itself.

You can find out more about character controllers on the reference page.
