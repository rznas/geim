# Physics Debug window reference

Use the Physics Debug window to configure and generate visual representations of 3D physics activity in a **scene**. These visualizations appear in the Scene view.

To open the Physics Debug window in the Unity Editor, go to **Window** > **Analysis** > **Physics Debugger**.

Physics Debugger inserts a Physics debug panel in the Scene view, and opens a Physics Debug window that contains the following tabs:

- **Info**: Track Rigidbody and Articulation Body information. **Center of Mass** and Inertia Tensor visualization can also be found here.
- **Filtering**: Determine which physics objects should be shown.
- **Rendering**: Settings that define how Unity renders and displays the physics visualization.
- **Contacts**: Select whether or not contacts should be visualized.
- **Queries**: Select whether or not queries should be visualized.

To revert the Physics Debug window back to its default settings, select **Reset**.

For more information on improving physics performance in your project, see documentation on the Physics Profiler.

## Physics debug panel

When the Physics Debug window is open in Unity, the Physics Debug panel appears in the Scene view. By default, it appears in the bottom-right corner of the Scene view; however, you can click and drag to move it around.

| **Property** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| ****Collision** Geometry** | Enable **Collision Geometry** to visualize collision information in the Scene view. Disable **Collision Geometry** to hide collision information in the Scene view. |
| **Mouse Select** | Enable **Mouse Select** to enable mouse-over highlighting and mouse selection. This is useful if you have large **GameObjects** that obstruct each other in the visualization. |

## Info

The **Info** tab contains data about any selected Rigidbody or ArticulationBody GameObjects. You can use this data to monitor the physics body’s behavior. You cannot edit the property values in this tab. You can modify them via script, but it is not recommended; in most cases, you should apply forces via the physics system to change these values instead.

To keep a specific GameObject permanently docked in the **Info** tab, enable **Lock** for that GameObject. You can lock an infinite number of GameObjects. Use the **Number of items per row** property to arrange the **Info** tab in a way that is easiest for you to navigate.

The Info tab always displays the following properties.

| **Property** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Number of items per row** | Define how many selected GameObjects to display horizontally in the top row of the **Info** tab.   By default, if you select or lock multiple GameObjects, Unity displays them all vertically. However, you can arrange them horizontally instead. Use **Number of items per row** to define how many GameObjects to display next to each other on one horizontal row, up to a maximum of 10.   If the number of selected or locked GameObjects exceeds this number, the more recently selected GameObjects appear on a new row underneath the first.  GameObjects always appear in the **Info** tab in the order of selection. The default value for this property is 1. |
| **Tracked objects** | Displays the total number of unique GameObjects that currently appear in the **Info** tab. This includes selected GameObjects and locked GameObjects. It does not include duplicates. |
| **Clear locked objects** | Select **Clear locked objects** to disable **Lock** for all GameObjects. This removes any GameObjects from the **Info** tab that are not already selected in the Hierarchy window. |

The **Info** tab displays the following properties when you select a GameObject in the Hierarchy that has a physics body (that is, a Rigidbody or an ArticulationBody).

| **Property** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **GameObject** | Displays the name of the selected or locked GameObject that the following properties refer to. |
| **Draw Gizmos for** | Select which physics property the Physics Debug should display a **gizmo** for. |
| - **Center of Mass** | Display a gizmo that indicates the location of the physics body’s global center of mass (see **World Center of Mass**). |
| - **Inertia Tensor** | Display a gizmo that indicates the rotation and scale of the physics body’s Inertia Tensor (see **Inertia Tensor**). |
| **Lock** | Enable **Lock** to keep the GameObject in the **Info** tab even when it is not selected in the Hierarchy window. |
| **Speed** | The speed at which the physics body is moving, measured in meters per second (m/s). |
| **Velocity** | The velocity of the physics body along each vector, measured in meters per second (m/s). |
| **Angular Velocity** | The velocity of the physics body along each vector, measured in degrees per second. |
| **Inertia Tensor** | The inertia tensor of this physics body. Like mass, an inertia tensor defines how much force or torque is required to make a physics body move; however, while mass affects linear movement, inertia tensor affects rotational movement. The higher the **Inertia Tensor** value is, the more torque is required to make the physics body rotate on its axis. |
| **Inertia Tensor Rotation** | The rotation of the inertia tensor. By default, Unity calculates inertia tensor rotation automatically, based on all of the **colliders** attached to the physics body. |
| **Local Center of Mass** | The local location of the physics body’s center of mass along each vector. To change the center of mass via script, use `centerOfMass`. Unity can also change it based on collider placement. |
| **World Center of Mass** | The global location of the physics body’s center of mass along each vector. To change the center of mass via script, use `worldCenterOfMass`. Unity can also change it based on collider placement. |
| **Sleep State** | The sleep state of the physics body. Displays **Awake** if the physics body is awake and included in physics calculations. Displays **Asleep** if the physics body is asleep, and not included in physics calculations. |
| **Sleep Threshold** | The energy threshold for the physics body, below which the **physics engine** stops including the body in physics updates. By default, this is the **Sleep Threshold** value defined in the global Physics settings. |
| **Max Linear Velocity** | The maximum linear velocity the physics body can reach, defined by `maxLinearVelocity`. |
| **Max Angular Velocity** | The maximum rotational velocity the physics body can reach, defined by `maxAngularVelocity`. |
| **Solver Iterations** | The number of iterations that the physics system solver needs to perform on this physics body. |
| **Solver Velocity Iteration** | The number of velocity iterations that the physics system solver needs to perform on this physics body. These bring the exit velocity of overlapping GameObjects closer to the correct value, taking into account the contact bounciness. |
| **Body Index** | The Articulation Body index in the tree. This property only appears for Articulation Bodies. |
