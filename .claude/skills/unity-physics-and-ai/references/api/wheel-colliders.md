# Wheel colliders

The **Wheel **collider**** is a collider for grounded vehicles. It has built-in **collision** detection, wheel physics, and a slip-based tire friction model. It can be used for objects other than wheels, but it is specifically designed for vehicles with wheels.

Unity’s PhysX integration uses the PhysX 4.1 Vehicles SDK to simulate the wheel assembly of ground vehicles (that is, the wheels, suspension, and braking). This documentation covers how to interact with this SDK in Unity; for details of the SDK itself, see the PhysX 4.1 Vehicles SDK documentation.

You don’t need to understand how a real-world vehicle works to build a simple simulation. However, an understanding of the main elements such as suspension and wheel behavior can help you work more precisely with the different vehicle simulation properties available in Unity.
