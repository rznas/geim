# Capsule collider component reference

The Capsule **collider** is a built-in 3D capsule-shaped collider made of two half-spheres joined together by a cylinder. It is useful for in-application items that have a cylindrical shape, or as a collider for player and non-player characters in a **scene**.

Because **Capsule colliders** have no corners, they are also useful to soften the **collision** area of sharp corners and edges in level geometry, so that players move more smoothly.

The Capsule collider has relatively low resource requirements.

| **Property** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Edit Collider** | Enable the **Edit Collider** button to display the collider’s contact points in the **Scene view**. You can click and drag these contact points to modify the size and shape of the collider. Alternatively, use the **Center**, **Radius**, and **Height** properties. |
| **Is Trigger** | Enable **Is Trigger** to use the collider as a trigger for events. When **Is Trigger** is enabled, other colliders pass through this collider, and trigger the messages `OnTriggerEnter`, `OnTriggerStay`, and `OnTriggerExit`. |
| **Provides Contacts** | Enable **Provides Contacts** to generate contact information for this collider at all times. Usually, a collider only generates contact data if there is something to send it to; in this case, the messages `OnCollisionEnter`, `OnCollisionStay`, or `OnCollisionExit`. When **Provides Contacts** is enabled, the collider generates contact data for the physics system at all times. Contact generation is resource-intensive, so **Provides Contacts** is disabled by default. |
| **Material** | Add the Physic Material component that determines the friction and bounciness of this collider. |
| **Center** | Define the position of the collider on each axis in the **GameObject**’s local space. By default, this is set to (0, 0, 0). |
| **Radius** | Define the radius of the collider from its center. You can adjust the **Radius** independently of the **Height**. By default, this is set to 0.5. |
| **Height** | Define the total height of the collider in **Unity units**. You can adjust the **Height** independently of the **Radius**. By default, this is set to 2. |
| **Direction** | Define the axis of the capsule’s lengthwise orientation in the object’s local space. |

## Layer overrides

The Layer Overrides section provides properties that allow you to override the project-wide Layer-based collision detection settings for this collider.

| **Property** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Layer Override Priority** | Define the priority of this collider override. When two colliders have conflicting overrides, the settings of the collider with the higher value priority are taken.  For example, if a collider with a **Layer Override Priority** of 1 collides with a Collider with a **Layer Override Priority** of 2, the physics system uses the settings for the Collider with the **Layer Override Priority** of 2. |
| **Include Layers** | Choose which Layers to include in collisions with this collider. |
| **Exclude Layers** | Choose which Layers to exclude in collisions with this collider. |
