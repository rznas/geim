# Hinge Joint component reference

The **Hinge **Joint**** groups together two Rigidbodies, constraining them to move like they are connected by a hinge. It is perfect for doors, but can also be used to model chains, pendulums, and other objects that have a similar hinge-like motion.

A single **Hinge Joint** should be applied to a ****GameObject****. The hinge rotates at the point specified by the **Anchor** property, moving around the specified **Axis** property.

The Hinge Joint has **Spring**, **Motor**, and **Limits** properties, which allow you to fine-tune the joint’s behaviors.

## Properties

| **Property** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Edit Angular Limits** | Adds a visual **gizmo** to the **Scene** view that helps you edit joint angular limits. To use this gizmo, set the **Angular X, Y, Z Motion** to **Limited** and then handles appear for you to drag and adjust the joint’s rotational space. |
| **Connected Body** | Optional reference to the Rigidbody that the joint is dependent upon. If you do not assign a **Connected Body** or **Connected Articulation Body**, the joint connects to the world.    You can use connected bodies to string multiple Hinge Joints together to create a chain. Add a joint to each link in the chain, and attach the next link as the **Connected Body**. |
| **Connected Articulation Body** | Optional reference to the ArticulationBody that the joint is dependent upon. If not set, the joint connects to the world. |
| **Anchor** | The position of the axis around which the body swings. The position is defined in local space. For example, for a normal door hinge, the **Anchor** is at the intersection between the door and the wall. For a door that is connected to the normal door, like a cat flap or a pet door, the normal door should be assigned as the pet door’s **Connected Body**, so that the pet door’s hinge is connected to the main door’s Rigidbody, rather than to a fixed point in world space. |
| **Axis** | The direction of the axis around which the body swings. The direction is defined in local space. For example, for a door that opens at the side, like a normal door hinge, the **Axis** is up, positive along the Y axis. For a door that opens from the bottom or top, like a cat flap or a pet door, the **Axis** is sideways, positive along the relative X axis. |
| **Auto Configure Connected Anchor** | If this is enabled, Unity calculates the Connected Anchor position automatically to match the global position of the anchor property. This is the default behavior. If this is disabled, you can configure the position of the connected anchor manually. |
| **Connected Anchor** | Manual configuration of the connected anchor position. |
| **Use Spring** | Spring makes the Rigidbody reach for a specific angle compared to its connected body.   **Spring** and **Motor** are intended to be mutually exclusive. Using both at the same time leads to unpredictable results. |
| **Spring** | Properties of the Spring that are used if **Use Spring** is enabled:   **Spring**: The force the object asserts to move into the position.  **Damper**: The higher this value, the more the object slows down.  **Target Position**: Target angle of the spring. The spring pulls towards this angle measured in degrees. |
| **Use Motor** | The motor makes the object spin around.   **Spring** and **Motor** are intended to be mutually exclusive. Using both at the same time leads to unpredictable results. |
| **Motor** | Properties of the Motor that are used if **Use Motor** is enabled:   **Target Velocity**: The speed the object tries to reach  **Force**: The force applied in order to reach the target velocity.  **Free Spin**: If enabled, the motor never decreases the rate of acceleration. |
| **Use Limits** | If enabled, the angle of the hinge is restricted within the **Min** & **Max** values. |
| **Extended Limits** | Activate to extend the angle of the hinge to 360 degrees in either direction (that is, a limit of [–360, 360]). |
| **Use Acceleration** | Activate to make the Hinge Joint’s spring output acceleration rather than force. |
| **Limits** | Properties of the Limits that are used if **Use Limits** is enabled:   **Min**: The lowest angle the rotation can go.  **Max**: The highest angle the rotation can go.  **Bounciness**: How much the object bounces when it hits the minimum or maximum stop limit.  **Contact Distance**: Within the contact distance from the limit contacts persist to avoid jitter. |
| **Break Force** | The force that needs to be applied for this joint to break. |
| **Break Torque** | The torque that needs to be applied for this joint to break. |
| **Enable **Collision**** | When checked, this enables collisions between bodies connected with a joint. |
| **Enable Preprocessing** | Disabling preprocessing helps to stabilize impossible-to-fulfil configurations. |
| **Mass Scale** | The scale to apply to the inverted mass and inertia tensor of the Rigidbody, ranging from 0.00001 to infinity. This is useful when the joint connects two Rigidbodies of largely varying mass. The physics solver produces better results when the connected Rigidbodies have a similar mass.   When your connected Rigidbodies vary in mass, use this property with the **Connect Mass Scale** property to apply fake masses to make them roughly equal to each other. This produces a high-quality and stable simulation, but reduces the physical behaviour of the Rigidbodies. |
| **Connected Mass Scale** | The scale to apply to the inverted mass and inertia tensor of the connected Rigidbody, ranging from 0.00001 to infinity. |
