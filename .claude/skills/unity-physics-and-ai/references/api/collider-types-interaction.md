# Interaction between collider types

The following **collision** matrix table describe which event messages Unity generates based on the configuration of each **collider** in a collision pair:

| **Collider types** | **Static collider** | **Dynamic collider** | **Kinematic collider** | **Static trigger collider** | **Dynamic trigger collider** | **Kinematic trigger collider** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Static collider** | No collision event message sent | **Collision detection** occurs and messages sent on collision | No collision event message sent | No collision event message sent | Trigger messages sent on collision | Trigger messages sent on collision |
| **Dynamic collider** | Collision detection occurs and messages sent on collision | Collision detection occurs and messages sent on collision | Collision detection occurs and messages sent on collision | Trigger messages sent on collision | Trigger messages sent on collision | Trigger messages sent on collision |
| **Kinematic collider** | No collision event message sent | Collision detection occurs and messages sent on collision | No collision event message sent | Trigger messages sent on collision | Trigger messages sent on collision | Trigger messages sent on collision |
| **Static trigger collider** | No collision event message sent | Trigger messages sent on collision | Trigger messages sent on collision | No collision event message sent | Trigger messages sent on collision | Trigger messages sent on collision |
| **Dynamic trigger collider** | Trigger messages sent on collision | Trigger messages sent on collision | Trigger messages sent on collision | Trigger messages sent on collision | Trigger messages sent on collision | Trigger messages sent on collision |
| **Kinematic trigger collider** | Trigger messages sent on collision | Trigger messages sent on collision | Trigger messages sent on collision | Trigger messages sent on collision | Trigger messages sent on collision | Trigger messages sent on collision |

## Collision generates collision detection messages

When a pair of colliders make contact, they generate collision detection messages if the following are both true:

- There is at least one dynamic collider.
- The other collider is a static collider, a kinematic collider, or another dynamic collider.

Trigger colliders don’t generate collision detection messages.

Unity only applies physics forces to collider **GameObjects** that have a physics body (a Rigidbody or ArticulationBody). When a physics body collider collides with a static collider, only the physics body collider behavior changes as a result of the collision (for example, it might bounce or slow down as a result of the collision).

## Collision generates trigger messages

Trigger messages occur in the following circumstances:

- A dynamic or kinematic trigger collider collides with any collider type.
- A static trigger collider collides with any dynamic or Kinematic collider.
