# Universal Render Pipeline compatibility in XR

Support for **XR** features in the Universal **Render Pipeline** (URP) varies by URP package version. This page details compatibility between XR features in Unity 6 and the latest compatible URP version.

To determine which version of URP is compatible with your current Unity version, refer to the Requirements and compatibility page in the Universal Render Pipeline documentation.

Unity 6 supports the following **AR** and **VR** features in the Universal Render Pipeline:

| **Feature** | **Supported in XR** |
| --- | --- |
| **Post-processing** effects: Bloom | Yes |
| Post-processing effects: MotionBlur | Yes |
| Post-processing effects: Lens Distortion | No |
| Post-processing effects: **Depth of Field** | Yes |
| Post-processing effects: **ToneMapping** | Yes |
| Spatial Temporal Post-Processing | No |
| Other post-processing effects (color adjustment, etc.) | Yes |
| GI (Global Illumination) | Yes |
| **HDR** | Yes |
| MSAA | Yes |
| Physical **Camera** | No |
| CopyColor / ColorDepth | Yes |
| Multi Display | No |
| Camera Stacking | Yes |
| Cascaded Shadow | Yes |
| sRGB | Yes |
| **Skybox** | Yes |
| Fog | Yes |
| **Billboard** | Yes |
| **Shader** Graph | Yes (1) |
| **Particles** | Yes |
| **Terrain** | Yes |
| 2D UI (Canvas Renderer, Text Mesh Pro) | Yes |
| URP Debug (Scene View Mode, Frame Debug) | Yes (2) |

- (1) Although Shader Graph shaders can run in XR, Shader Graph doesn’t currently support the XR utility feature to create SPI-compatible shader input textures. Unity will expand support for Shader Graph functionality in future releases.
- (2) Unity supports frame debugging for mock HMDs. Currently, there is no support for Meta/Oculus.

In Unity 6.3 and newer, you can use on-tile post-processing to enable certain URP post-processing effects on XR devices. Refer to On-tile post-processing (URP) to learn more about on-tile post-processing and how to enable it in your XR project.

To learn more about post-processing effects, refer to the Effect list page in the Universal Render Pipeline documentation.
