# Optimize shaders

This page contains information on optimizing your **shaders** for runtime performance, especially on mobile platforms that have limited GPU performance.

## Avoid complex calculations

To avoid complex calculations, do the following for example:

- Use lookup textures instead of resource-intensive functions such as `pow`, `log` and `sin`.
- Use Unity HLSL functions, such as `normalize` and `dot`, instead of writing your own. This ensures that the driver can generate better code.

## Avoid repeated calculations

To avoid shaders repeating calculations, do the following for example:

- Move calculations from the fragment shader to the **vertex shader**, so they run only for every vertex, not every fragment.
- Do calculations in a C# script instead, then use the calculated value in the shader.
- Avoid unnecessary calculations. For example, remove code that supports multiple colors per material if you always use the same color.

## Use lower precision data types

Use `half` instead of `float` for all variables except world space coordinates and texture coordinates. For more information, refer to Use 16-bit precision in shaders.

## Use casts instead of suffixes

Unity doesn’t support suffixes, so a value like `2.0h` becomes a full `float`. This means when the GPU does calculations, it might have to convert other values to `float` and back. This can slow down the shader.

To prevent this, use casts instead of suffixes. For example, use `half(2.0)` instead of `2.0h`.

## Avoid discarding pixels or channels

To avoid shaders slowing down, avoid the following resource-intensive methods:

- The `discard` method in the fragment shader.
- ColorMask on mobile platforms.

## Avoid writing to the depth buffer

To ensure mobile GPUs can use early depth testing to speed up rendering, don’t write to the **depth buffer** in the fragment shader.

For more information about depth testing, refer to ShaderLab command: ZTest.

## Prioritize lower quality shaders with the LOD command

To set Unity to prioritise lower quality shaders on lower-end hardware, use the `LOD` command in your **ShaderLab** code.

**Note:** Although this technique is named after the **LOD** feature for rendering meshes, there are important differences: shader LOD does not relate to distance from the **Camera**, and Unity does not calculate shader LOD automatically. You must set the maximum shader LOD manually.

Follow these steps:

1. Assign LOD values to subshaders. The lower the value, the less computationally demanding the subshader is. For example: `Shader "Examples/ExampleLOD" { SubShader { LOD 200 ... } SubShader { LOD 100 ... } }` If you have multiple subshaders in a single **Shader object**, make sure subshaders are in descending LOD order with the highest LOD value first. This is because Unity selects the first valid SubShader it finds, so if it finds one with a lower LOD first it will always use that.
2. At runtime, set the **shader LOD** value for a single Shader object, or for all Shader objects. Use Shader.maximumLOD. To set the shader LOD for all Shader objects, you can use Shader.globalMaximumLOD. By default, there is no maximum LOD.

Unity now prioritises SubShaders that have a lower LOD value. For information on how Unity chooses when to use SubShaders, see How Unity selects a subshader.
