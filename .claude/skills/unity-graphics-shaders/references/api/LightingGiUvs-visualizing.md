# Check lightmap UVs

It is important to be able to view the lightmap UVs that are being used, and Unity has a visualization tool to help you with this. First, open the Lighting window (menu: **Window** > **Rendering** > **Lighting**) and tick the **Auto** checkbox at the bottom. This ensures that your bake and precompute are up-to-date, and outputs the data that is needed to view the UVs. Wait for the process to finish (this can take some time for large or complex Scenes).

## Check real-time lightmap UVs

To see the UVs for the Realtime **Global Illumination** system:

- Select a **GameObject** with a ****Mesh** Renderer** component.
- In the ****Mesh Renderer**** component, in the **Lightmapping** section, open the **Realtime **Lightmap**** dropdown.
- Double-click a lightmap texture to open the **Viewer** window.
- In the **Viewer** window, open the dropdown and select **UV Charts**.

This displays the UV layout for the real-time lightmap of the selected instance of this Mesh.

- The UV charts are indicated by the different colored areas in the Preview shown in the image above on the rightmost side.
- The UV layout of the selected instance is laid over the charts, as a wireframe representation of the GameObject’s Mesh.
- Dark gray texels show unused areas of the lightmap.

Unity packs multiple UV layouts with their UV charts into a UV atlas, which Unity turns into the real-time lightmap texture. Some of the charts you see might actually belong to other GameObjects.

## Check baked lightmap UVs

To see the UVs for the Baked Global Illumination system:

- Select a GameObject with a **Mesh Renderer** component.
- In the **Mesh Renderer** component, in the **Lightmapping** section, open the **Baked Lightmap** dropdown.
- Double-click a lightmap texture to open the **Viewer** window.
- In the **Viewer** window, open the dropdown and select **Baked UV Charts**.

As you can see, the baked UV layouts are very different to the precomputed real-time UV layouts. This is because the requirements for baked and precomputed real-time UVs are different.
