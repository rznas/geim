# Create a particle material in the Built-In Render Pipeline

The Unity Standard **Particle** Shaders are built-in shaders that enable you to render a variety of **Particle System** effects. These shaders provide various particle-specific features that aren’t available with the Standard **Shader**.

To use a Particle Shader:

1. Select the Material you want to apply the shader to. For example, you could apply a Flame Material to a Fire Particle System effect.
2. In the Material’s **Inspector**, select **Shader Particles**.
3. Choose the Particle Shader that you want to use, such as **Standard Surface**.
4. Enable and disable the various Particle Shader properties in the Inspector.

## Types of particle shader

Unity has the following types of particle shader:

- Standard Particles **Surface Shader** - This comes with functionality similar to the Standard Shader, but works especially well with particles. Like the Standard Shader, it supports **Physically Based Shading**. It does not include features that are unsuitable for dynamic particles, such as lightmapping.
- Standard Particles Unlit Shader - This simple shader is faster than the Surface Shader. It supports all of the generic particle controls, such as flipbook blending and distortion, but does not perform any lighting calculations.
