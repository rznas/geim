# Introduction to Custom Render Textures

**Custom Render Textures** are a special type of texture that allow you to update a texture with a **shader**. They are an extension to Render Textures. You can use Custom Render Textures to create complex simulations like caustics, ripple simulation for rain effects, and liquid splatters.

The Custom Render Textures feature provides a scripting and Shader framework to help with complicated configuration like varying update frequency, partial or multi-pass updates.

To use this framework you need to assign a Material to the Custom Render Texture asset. Custom Render Textures require a compatible Material. For more information, see Writing a shader for a Custom Render Texture.

## Render Pipeline Compatibility

The following table describes the compatibility between the **Custom Render Textures** feature and each **render pipeline**:

| Feature | Universal Render Pipeline (URP) | High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP) | Custom Scriptable Render Pipeline (SRP) | Built-in Render Pipeline |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Custom Render Textures | Yes (1) | Yes (1) | Yes (1) | Yes (1) |

**Note:**

1. To create Materials that update and initialize **Custom Render Textures** in [Shader Graph](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.shadergraph@latest), selecting **Custom Render Texture** as the target of the shader graph.
