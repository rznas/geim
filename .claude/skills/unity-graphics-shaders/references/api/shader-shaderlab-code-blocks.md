# Shader code blocks in ShaderLab reference

This page contains information about using **shader** code blocks. For information about writing HLSL itself, refer to Writing HLSL shader programs.

## HLSL

`HLSLPROGRAM` and `HLSLINCLUDE` are compatible with all **render pipelines**.

| **Signature** | **Function** |
| --- | --- |
| `HLSLPROGRAM`  `[source code for shader programs]` `ENDHLSL` | Creates a shader program block. Unity adds the HLSL shader program to the pass that includes this shader program block. |
| `HLSLINCLUDE`  `[code that you want to share]` `ENDHLSL` | Creates a shader include block. Unity includes this code in all shader programs that are defined in `HLSLPROGRAM` blocks, anywhere in this source file. |

## CG

`CGPROGRAM` and `CGINCLUDE` are compatible only with the Built-In Render Pipeline. For most uses, use `HLSLPROGRAM` and `HLSLINCLUDE` instead, unless you write surface shaders.

If you use `CGPROGRAM`, Unity includes several of Unity’s built-in shader include files by default, enabling you to use built-in variables and functions. As a result, shaders that use `CGPROGRAM` might not work if you change the keyword to `HLSLPROGRAM`.

**Note**: Although the shader library files in the Built-In Render Pipeline have a .cginc file extension, they contain HLSL code rather than CG code.

| **Signature** | **Function** |
| --- | --- |
| `CGPROGRAM`  `[source code for shader programs]` `ENDCG` | Creates a shader program block. Unity adds the shader program to the pass that includes this shader program block. |
| `CGINCLUDE`  `[code that you want to share]` `ENDCG` | Create a shader include block. Unity includes this code in all shader programs that are defined in `CGPROGRAM` blocks, anywhere in this source file. |
