# Material Inspector window reference

You can view and edit a Material asset in the ****Inspector**** window.

The Material Inspector makes it possible to do the following things:

- Modify a Material or Material Variant’s Properties
- Identify and change its relationships with other Materials and Material Variant
- Copy and paste its Property settings
- Associate it with a **shader** or **lightmap** atlas

See Materials introduction to learn more about Materials.

## Settings

Click Material Controls to open the selected Material’s Settings menu.

| **Setting** | **Function** |
| --- | --- |
| **Select Shader** | Move focus to this shader asset in the **Project window**. This can aid navigation in a Project with many Assets. |
| **Edit Shader** | Open the source file for the shader asset that this Material uses. |
| **Select Material** | Move focus to this Material asset in the Project window. This can aid navigation in a Project with many Assets. |
| **Flatten Material Variant** | Convert this Material Variant to a Material and retain its Property values. Only available when the selected Material is a Variant. |
| **Copy Material Properties** | Copy Material Property values so that you can copy them to other Materials. |
| **Paste Material Properties** | Paste Material Property values into this Material from the computer’s clipboard. Only available when there are Property Values in the clipboard. |
| **Create Material Preset** | Create a duplicate of this Material’s Property settings. See Presets for more information. By default, Unity creates the duplicate in the same asset directory as this Material. |
| **Copy Atlas** | Copy the font atlas to the keyboard. Only for Text Mesh Pro Materials. |
| **Paste Atlas** | Paste a Text **Mesh** Pro font atlas into this Material. |
| **Reset** | Reset all Material properties to the default values specified by the shader associated with this Material. |

## Advanced Options

The properties the Unity Editor displays for a Material depend on the Material Properties defined by the shader that this Material uses. However, all Materials share three **Advanced Options**.

| **Advanced Options** | **Function** |
| --- | --- |
| **Render Queue** | Select a Render Queue. The Material’s shader determines the default Render Queue value. Corresponds to the Material.renderQueue property. |
| **Enable GPU Instancing** | Optimize draw calls for meshes that use this Material. See GPU Instancing for more information. |
| **Double Sided Global Illumination** | Instruct the Progressive Lightmappers to consider backfaces in global illumination calculations. When this option is active, back-facing polygons bounce light using the same emission and albedo values as front-facing polygons.    **Note**: The appearance of back-facing polygons does not change when you enable this option because this option does not cause Unity to render back-facing polygons or add them to lightmaps.  Corresponds to the Material.doubleSidedGI property. |
