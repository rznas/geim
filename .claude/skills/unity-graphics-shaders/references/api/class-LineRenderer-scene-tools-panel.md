# Line Renderer Scene Tools panel reference

The properties in the **Scene** Tools panel change depending on whether the ****Line Renderer** Scene Editing Mode** is set to **None**, **Edit Points**, or **Create Points**.

To set the current Scene Editing Mode, use the **Edit Points** and **Create Points** buttons.

## Scene Editing Mode: None

By default, there is no Scene Editing Mode set.

| **Control** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Simplify Preview** | Enable **Simplify Preview** to see a preview of the results of the simplification operation. |
| **Tolerance** | Set the amount by which the simplified line can deviate from the original line.  A value of 0 results in no deviation, and therefore little or no simplification. Higher positive values result in more deviation from the original line, and therefore more simplification.  The default value is 1. |
| **Simplify** | Click **Simplify** to reduce the number of elements in the Line Renderer’s **Positions** array.  The simplification operation uses the [Ramer-Douglas-Peucker algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramer%E2%80%93Douglas%E2%80%93Peucker_algorithm) to reduce the number of points, based on the **Tolerance** value. |

## Scene Editing Mode: Edit Points

To set the Scene Editing Mode to **Edit Points**, select the **Edit Points** button. Select it again to set the Scene Editing Mode to **None**.

| **Control** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Show Wireframe** | When enabled, Unity draws a wireframe in the **Scene view** that visualizes the line. |
| **Subdivide Selected** | This button is enabled when you select two or more adjacent points. Pressing this button inserts a new point between the selected adjacent points. |

## Scene Editing Mode: Create Points

To set the Scene Editing Mode to **Create Points**, select the **Create Points** button. Select it again to set the Scene Editing Mode to **None**.

| **Control** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Input** | Set the input method you want to use to create points. The options are:   **Mouse position**: Create points based on the mouse position in the Scene view.  **Physics Raycast**: Create points based on a raycast into the Scene. Unity creates the point at the position where the raycast hits. |
| ****Layer Mask**** | The layer mask to use when performing a raycast. This property is visible only when **Input** is set to **Physics Raycast**. |
| **Min Vertex Distance** | When you drag the mouse to create points in the Scene view, the Line Renderer creates a new point when this distance from the last point is exceeded. |
| **Offset** | The offset applied to created points. When **Input** is set to **Mouse Position**, Line Renderer applies the offset from the Scene **camera**. When Input is set to **Physics Raycast**, Line Renderer applies the offset from the raycast normal. |
