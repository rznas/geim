# Procedural Skybox Shader Material Inspector Window reference

For information on how to create a Material that uses this **skybox** **Shader**, as well as details on how to render the skybox in your **Scene**, see Using skyboxes.

## Render pipeline compatibility

| **Feature** | **Built-in **Render Pipeline**** | **Universal Render Pipeline (URP)** | **High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP)** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Procedural skybox** | Yes | Yes | No |

## Properties

| **Property** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Sun** | The method Unity uses the generate a sun disk in the skybox. The options are: • **None:** Disables the sun disk in the skybox. • **Simple:** Draws a simplified sun disk into the skybox • **High Quality:** Draws a sun disk into the skybox. This is similar to the **Simple** sun disk, but with this mode, you can use **Sun Size Convergence** to further customize the appearance of the sun disk. |
| **Sun Size** | The size modifier for the sun disk. Larger values make the sun disk appear larger and setting this value to **0** makes the sun disk disappear. |
| **Sun Size Convergence** | The size convergence of the sun. Smaller values make the sun disk appear larger. This property only appears if you set **Sun** to **High Quality**. |
| **Atmosphere Thickness** | The density of the atmosphere. An atmosphere of higher density absorbs more light. Unity uses the Rayleigh scattering method to absorb light. |
| **Sky Tint** | The color to tint the sky to. |
| **Ground** | The color of the ground (the area below the horizon). |
| **Exposure** | Adjusts the sky’s exposure. This allows you to change tonal values in the skybox this Material generates. Larger values produce a more exposed, seemingly brighter, skybox. Smaller values produce a less exposed, seemingly darker, skybox. |
