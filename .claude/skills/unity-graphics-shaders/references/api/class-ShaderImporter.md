# Shader Import Settings window reference

View and edit properties and settings for a shader.

## ShaderLab shader properties

The following properties are available only for ShaderLab shaders.

| **Property** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Default Maps** | Displays the textures that appear as material properties. |
| **NonModifiable Maps** | Displays the textures that have the `[NonModifiableTextureData]` attribute in the shader. These textures don’t appear as material properties. |

## Shader graph properties

The following properties are available only for shader graphs.

| **Property** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Open Shader Editor** | Opens the **Shader Graph** window so you can edit the shader graph. |
| **View Generated Shader** | Opens your text editor with the **ShaderLab** shader code that Shader Graph generates. |
| **Copy Shader** | Copies the ShaderLab shader code that Shader Graph generates to the clipboard. |

## Imported object

| **Property** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Surface Shader** | Opens your text editor with the shader Unity generates, if the shader is a surface shader. |
| **Fixed Function** | Opens your text editor with the shader Unity generates, if the shader is a fixed function shader. |
| **Preprocess only** | Sets **Compile and show code** to generate only the preprocessed code, instead of the final code. For more information, refer to Shader compilation. |
| **Strip #line directives** | Removes `#line` statements that display how the preprocessed code maps to the original ShaderLab and HLSL code. This property is available only if you enable **Preprocess only**. |
| **Compiled code** | Select **Compile and show code** to open your text editor with the shader code Unity compiles. Use the dropdown to select which graphics APIs and platforms Unity compiles the code for. For more information, refer to Compiled code dropdown.  This property is only available for code shaders. For shader graphs, select **View Generated Shader**. |
| **Cast shadows** | Displays whether geometry casts shadows when it uses this shader. |
| **Render queue** | Displays which render queue Unity uses for geometry that uses this shader. For more information, refer to Set the render pipeline and render order for a shader. |
| ****LOD**** | Displays the shader LOD value of the shader, which Unity uses to prioritize shaders. For more information, refer to Optimize shaders. |
| **Ignore projector** | Displays whether geometry that uses this shader receives effects from projector components. |
| **Disable batching** | Displays whether the shader prevents Unity from applying **dynamic batching** to geometry that uses the shader. For more information, refer to Batch meshes at runtime. |
| **Keywords** | Displays the **Overridable** and **Not Overridable** keywords the shader defines. For more information, refer to shader keywords. |
| **SRP Batcher** | Displays whether the shader is compatible with the Scriptable Render Pipeline (SRP) Batcher. |
| **Properties** | Displays the properties in the `Properties` block of the shader code. For more information, refer to Properties block reference in ShaderLab. |

### Compiled code dropdown

For more information, refer to Shader compilation.

| **Property** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Current graphics device** | Compiles the shader code for the graphics device on your current machine. |
| **Current build platform** | Compiles the shader code for the current build platform. For more information, refer to Build profiles |
| **All platforms** | Compiles the shader code for all platforms and graphics APIs. |
| **Custom** | Compiles the shader code for the graphics APIs you select. The options are:  **D3D**: Compiles shader code into DirectX Bytecode (DXBC) for DirectX 11 or DirectX 12.  **GLES3x**: Compiles shader code into OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL).  **Metal**: Compiles shader code into Metal Shading Language (MSL).  **OpenGLCore**: Compiles shader code into OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL).  **Vulkan**: Compiles shader code into SPIR-V.  **WebGPU**: Compiles shader code into WebGPU Shading Language (WGSL). |
| **Skip unused shader_features** | Strips shader variants that materials don’t use. For more information, refer to Changing how shaders work via branching and keywords. |

The bottom of the **Compiled code** dropdown displays the number of shader variants Unity compiles. Select **Show** to open your text editor with a list of the shader variants.
