# Other methods to warm up shaders

Warm up **shaders** if your build targets the DirectX 11, OpenGL, OpenGLES, or **WebGL** graphics APIs.

If your project uses the DirectX 11, OpenGL, OpenGLES, or WebGL graphics APIs, Unity provides multiple methods to warm up shaders in your project.

## Use the GraphicsStateCollection API (recommended)

The GraphicsStateCollection API is compatible with DirectX 11, OpenGL, OpenGLES, or WebGL. On these APIs, `GraphicsStateCollection` automatically fallbacks to shader warm up. The `GraphcsStateCollection` API is the recommended method of warming up shaders. To learn more about warming up shaders with this API, refer to Warm up PSOs.

**Note**: `GraphicsStateCollection` automatic fallback is available in Unity 6.1 and later. If your project uses an older version of Unity, use an alternative method of shader warmup outlined in the following section.

## Other methods to warm up shaders

On DirectX 11, OpenGL, OpenGLES, or WebGL graphics APIs, you can also use the following methods to warm up shaders:

- To warm up a **Shader object**, use the Experimental.Rendering.ShaderWarmup API.
- To warm up all variants of all Shader objects currently in memory, use the Shader.WarmupAllShaders API.

To warm up a shader variant collection, do any of the following:

- Use the Experimental.Rendering.ShaderWarmup API.
- Use the ShaderVariantCollection.WarmUp API.
- Add the shader variant collection to the Preloaded shaders section of the Graphics Settings window. Unity then uses the `ShaderVariantCollection.WarmUp` to warm up the shader variants when your built application starts.

**Note**: These methods aren’t recommended on Vulkan, DirectX 12, and Metal because they can create the wrong PSOs due to missing graphics states.
