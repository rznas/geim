# Add ambient light from the environment

Ambient light, also known as diffuse environmental light, is light that is present all around the **Scene** and doesn’t come from any specific source object. It can be an important contributor to the overall look and brightness of a scene.

Ambient light can be useful in a number of cases, depending upon your chosen art style. An example would be bright, cartoon-style rendering where dark shadows may be undesirable or where lighting is perhaps hand-painted into textures. **Ambient light** can also be useful if you need to increase the overall brightness of a scene without adjusting individual lights.

## Add ambient light

After you create a skybox material, Unity can use it to generate ambient lighting in your Scene. To make Unity do this:

1. Open the Lighting window (menu: **Window** > **Rendering** > **Lighting**).
2. Select the **Environment** tab.
3. Assign your chosen **skybox** to the **Skybox Material** property.
4. Click the **Source** drop-down and, from the list, click **Skybox**.
