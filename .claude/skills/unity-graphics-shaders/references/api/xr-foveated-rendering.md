# Foveated rendering

Foveated rendering is an optimization technique in which the areas of the display at the periphery of the user’s vision are rendered at a lower resolution. Foveated rendering can improve rendering performance with little impact on perceived visual quality.

Foveated rendering gets its name from the fovea, which is a small portion of the eye containing the densest group of photoreceptor nerves. The goal of foveated rendering is to vary the rendering resolution across the screen so that only the part that can be perceived by the fovea is rendered at the highest resolution.

XR platforms implement foveated rendering with a variety of techniques, such as Variable Rate Shading (VRS) and Variable Rate **Rasterization** (VRR). The technique used can change how shaders must sample textures when foveated rendering is active. To allow assets to work on any platform, Unity provides **shader** macros, keywords, and pre-processor symbols that you can use to adapt shaders so that screen-space calculations produce correct results on all platforms. Refer to Foveated rendering shaders for information on how to use them. (Shaders provided by Unity and URP already use these macros.)

XR devices can support foveated rendering in one of two modes:

- **Fixed foveated rendering** renders the central area of the display for each eye at the highest resolution and lowers the resolution of the periphery.
- **Gaze-based foveated rendering** uses eye tracking to determine where the highest resolution area of the screen is located. This form of foveated rendering can only be supported on devices with eye tracking.

Currently, the **XR** platforms that use **VRS** and a uniform raster for foveated rendering, include **OpenXR** and **Meta Quest**. The XR platforms that use VRR and a non-uniform raster for foveated rendering, include **visionOS** (when rendering with the Metal graphics API).

## Prerequisites

To use foveated rendering, your project must meet the following prerequisites:

- Unity 6+, 2022.3, or 2023.2.
- Universal **Render Pipeline** (URP).
- Settings configured in the XR provider **plug-in**, if necessary.
- On PC standalone XR, the project must use the Direct3D12 or Vulkan graphics APIs.
- On PC standalone XR, the computer running the app must have a recent GPU (such as Nvidia RTX2000+ or AMD RX6000+).
- On standalone XR platforms, both the XR provider plug-in and the device must support foveated rendering. (Refer to your provider plug-in documentation for more information.)

**Notes:**

- Some XR provider plug-ins support foveated rendering on 2022.3 and the Built-in Render Pipeline using a different API and implementation. Refer to the plug-in documentation for more information. These plug-ins include OpenXR and Oculus.
- Fixed foveated rendering is compatible with **dynamic resolution** using `XRSettings.renderViewportScale`. Refer to Resolution control in XR projects for more information.
- Unity does not support foveated rendering in projects using the Built-In Rendering Pipeline.

## Enable foveated rendering

To enable foveated rendering for a Unity project, go to the **XR Plug-in Management** section of your **Project Settings** (menu: **Edit > Project Settings**). An option to enable the feature appears in the settings section for each plug-in that supports foveated rendering. Refer to the documentation of the XR provider plug-in for information about the available settings.

In addition to enabling the option in settings, you must also set the foveated rendering level at runtime, as described in Control foveated rendering.

**Note:** XR platforms can provide different levels of control for foveated rendering. For example, when you use Metal rendering on visionOS, fixed foveated rendering is always at full strength when enabled.

## Control foveated rendering

Control foveated rendering by setting the foveatedRenderingLevel property of the XRDisplaySubsystem to a value between zero and one. You must enable foveated runtime in your project’s provider plug-in settings or the runtime setting is ignored.

The following example method sets the foveation level:

```
public void SetFRLevel(XRDisplaySubsystem xrDisplaySubsystem, float strength)
{
    xrDisplaySubsystem.foveatedRenderingLevel = strength;
}
```

If you set the foveated rendering level to zero, foveation is turned off and does not affect rendering.

On devices that support eye-tracked or gaze-based, foveated rendering, you can enable the feature by setting the foveatedRenderingFlags property of the XRDisplaySubsystem:

```
// xrDisplaySubsystem is the active XRDisplaySystem instance
xrDisplaySubsystem.foveatedRenderingFlags = XRDisplaySubsystem.FoveatedRenderingFlags.GazeAllowed;
```

You can enable gaze-based foveated rendering by setting the foveatedRenderingFlags property on devices that support it, even if you chose fixed foveated rendering at runtime.

**Note:** Get the XRDisplaySubsystem from the SubsystemManager. It can take up to three frames for the XRDisplaySubsystem to fully initialize. You should wait for three frames before accessing the properties and methods of the class.

The following enables foveated rendering at 50% strength and sets the rendering flags to allow gaze-based foveation. The example uses a coroutine to wait three frames to make sure the subsystem is ready.

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.Android;
using UnityEngine.XR;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Collections;
public class FoveationStarter : MonoBehaviour
{
    [Range(0, 1)]
    public float foveationStrength = 0.5f;
    public bool AllowGaze = false;
    
    List<XRDisplaySubsystem> xrDisplays = new List<XRDisplaySubsystem>();

    void Start()
    {
        StartCoroutine(WaitForXRDisplay());

        if (AllowGaze)
        {
            // Request eye tracking permission for Quest devices
            Permission.RequestUserPermission("com.oculus.permission.EYE_TRACKING");
        }
    }

    IEnumerator WaitForXRDisplay()
    {
        yield return new WaitUntil(() => Time.frameCount >= 3);

        SubsystemManager.GetSubsystems(xrDisplays);
        if (xrDisplays.Count == 1)
        {
            xrDisplays[0].foveatedRenderingLevel = foveationStrength;
            if(AllowGaze){
                xrDisplays[0].foveatedRenderingFlags =
                    XRDisplaySubsystem.FoveatedRenderingFlags.GazeAllowed;
            }
            Debug.Log($"Foveated rendering set to {xrDisplays[0].foveatedRenderingLevel}.");
        }
        else
        {
            Debug.LogWarning($"Couldn't find an XRDisplaySubsystem for foveated rendering.");
        }
    }
}
```

Some devices require that you ask for the user’s permission before you can access eye tracking data. The example demonstrates how to request this permission for the Android-based Quest Pro device. Other XR devices and platforms use different permission strings, APIs, or other mechanisms for requesting permissions.

## Get foveated rendering capabilities

You can get the foveated rendering capabilities of the current device from the foveatedRenderingCaps property of the SystemInfo object.

```
FoveatedRenderingCaps caps = SystemInfo.foveatedRenderingCaps;
```

If the property reports the FoveatedRenderingCaps.None, then the device does not support foveated rendering. Lack of support could be caused by various reasons, including software, device runtime, or drivers, so even if a platform supports foveated rendering, it might not be available on a particular device.

The other values of FoveatedRenderingCaps, FoveationImage and NonUniformRaster, provide information about the way a device implements foveated rendering and might be useful if you are implementing a custom render pipeline. `FoveationImage` indicates that the foveated rendering implementation uses VRS, while `NonUniformRaster` indicates that it uses VRR.

## Foveated rendering shaders

Shaders included with the Unity Engine already support both uniform and non-uniform rasterization for foveated rendering. If you have custom shaders that perform screen-space calculations, you might need to update them to support foveated rendering on platforms that use a non-uniform raster technique.

The **pixels** rendered with a non-uniform raster no longer represent a regular grid, so you must change any screen space calculations that assume a regular grid in order for them to work correctly with VRR. Unity provides shader macros, keywords, and pre-processor symbols that you can use to adapt shaders so that screen-space calculations produce correct results on all platforms. (Shaders provided by Unity and URP already use these macros.)

For example, the left side of the following image, shows a view of a **scene** rendered with VRR without correcting for the non-uniform rasterization. The right side of the image shows the same view when rendered correctly:

*Uncorrected non-uniform rasterization (left) compared to linear rasterization (right).*

Notice how areas near the edges of the image on the left are squished. This visual **compression** occurs because the peripheral areas of the texture were rasterized with a lower pixel density. When sampling this texture, you would need to use non-uniform UV coordinates (or convert linear UV coordinates to non-uniform using one of the provided foveated rendering shader functions).

**Note:** Unity uses the term, “non-uniform raster,” to describe the space the pixels have been rasterized into when using a VRR technique and uses the term, “linear raster,” to refer to the more usual rasterization space with a regular grid.

To update your screen-space shaders for URP to produce correct results under foveated rendering, add the following include files (from the Core RP Library package):

```
#include_with_pragmas "Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.core/ShaderLibrary/FoveatedRenderingKeywords.hlsl"
#include "Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.core/ShaderLibrary/FoveatedRendering.hlsl"
```

These files contain keywords and macros for foveated rendering, as well as functions to map screen-space coordinates from non-uniform to linear and vice versa.

### How foveated rendering affects shader compatibility

The variable rate shading (VRS) techniques change the number of screen pixels shaded by each call to a fragment shader based on where a region is within the user’s field of view. Variable rate shading is compatible with existing shaders. You should not need to alter custom shaders to work under foveated rendering on XR platforms that use VRS.

The variable rate rasterization (VRR) technique adjusts rasterization such that the effective distance between neighboring pixels is no longer uniform. For example, a peripheral region of the field of view might be rendered to a lower resolution texture that is then stretched when composited to the final display. Because rasterization is non-uniform, shaders performing calculations in screen space can produce incorrect results under VRR if they assume that the rasterization uses a uniform grid. You might need to alter custom shaders to work under foveated rendering on XR platforms that use VRR.

### When to use foveated rendering functions

When you sample a linear texture, you should use linear coordinates. Conversely, when you sample a non-uniform texture, you should use non-uniform coordinates.

All vertex attributes passed from the **vertex shader** to the fragment (pixel) shader are always in linear space with the exception of `SV_POSITION`. You can sample a non-uniform texture with the `SV_POSITION` coordinates directly, but if you use other vertex attributes for sampling, you must use the appropriate linear-to-non-uniform remapping function. Similarly, if you use `SV_POSITION` to sample a linear texture, you must use the `FoveatedRemapNonUniformToLinear` function.

The coordinate space of textures varies according to how they are created. Most textures created by the Unity Engine, such as the **depth buffer** and G buffers, are in the non-uniform space when rendering with VRR. (However, there are exceptions, which aren’t currently documented.) Manually created screen-space textures, such as a UI overlay drawn by an artist are normally linear and you should sample them with linear UV coordinates.

In compute shaders, you must consider whether source and destination textures are in linear or non-uniform space and remap coordinates as needed before sampling or writing to them. Likewise, consider the source of UV coordinates, how they might be calculated within the compute shader, and whether any functions they are passed to expect linear or non-uniform coordinates. Refer to the Compute Shaders topic and the ComputeShader API for general information about compute shaders in Unity.

### Shader functions for foveated rendering

[FoveatedRendering.hlsl](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/Graphics/blob/master/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.core/ShaderLibrary/FoveatedRendering.hlsl) defines a set of functions that you can use to support foveated rendering in your custom shaders. These functions return the correct results whether the current foveated rendering type is linear or non-uniform, and when foveated rendering is not being used. The functions also handle inverting the y axis according to whether the platform places the screen space origin at the top or bottom of the screen.

**Note:** These functions have no performance impact on platforms that don’t employ non-uniform foveated rendering (VRR). You do not need to use conditional `#ifdef` statements to exclude them. However, on platforms that do use VRR, there is a dynamic branch to check the shader constant that adds a small amount of overhead, even when foveated rendering is disabled.

#### FoveatedRemapLinearToNonUniform

Declaration: `float2 FoveatedRemapLinearToNonUniform(float2 uv)`

Converts linear, screen-space UV coordinates to non-uniform, including any necessary y-axis inversion. If foveated rendering is not active or the platform doesn’t use non-uniform rasterization, the function returns the UV coordinates unchanged.

#### FoveatedRemapNonUniformToLinear

Declaration: `float2 FoveatedRemapNonUniformToLinear(float2 uv)`

Converts non-uniform screen-space UV coordinates to linear, including any necessary y-axis inversion. If foveated rendering is not active or the platform doesn’t use non-uniform rasterization, the function returns the UV coordinates unchanged.

#### FoveatedRemapPrevFrameLinearToNonUniform

Declaration: `float2 FoveatedRemapPrevFrameLinearToNonUniform(float2 uv)`

Remaps linear screen-space UV coordinates based on the previously rendered frame. (Not implemented on Metal.)

#### FoveatedRemapPrevFrameNonUniformToLinear

Declaration: `float2 FoveatedRemapPrevFrameNonUniformToLinear(float2 uv)`

Remaps non-uniform screen-space UV coordinates based on the previously rendered frame. (Not implemented on Metal.)

#### FoveatedRemapDensity

Declaration: `float2 FoveatedRemapDensity(float2 uv)`

The ratio between the screen resolution and the raster resolution at the specified screen UV coordinate. If foveated rendering is not active or the platform doesn’t use non-uniform rasterization, the function returns (1.0, 1.0). (Not implemented on Metal.)

#### FoveatedRemapPrevFrameDensity

Declaration: `float2 FoveatedRemapPrevFrameDensity(float2 uv)`

The density ratio at the time of the previous frame. (Not implemented on Metal.)

#### FoveatedRemapLinearToNonUniformCS

Declaration: `float2 FoveatedRemapLinearToNonUniformCS(float2 positionCS)`

Converts linear-space screen coordinates to non-uniform-space screen coordinates. If foveated rendering is not active or the platform doesn’t use non-uniform rasterization, the function returns the coordinates unchanged.

#### FoveatedRemapNonUniformToLinearCS

Declaration: `float2 FoveatedRemapNonUniformToLinearCS(float2 positionCS)`

Converts non-uniform-space screen coordinates to linear-space screen coordinates. If foveated rendering is not active or the platform doesn’t use non-uniform rasterization, the function returns the coordinates unchanged.

### Convert UV

To convert a UV coordinate in linear screen space to non-uniform raster screen space, use the following:

```
uvNonUniform = FoveatedRemapLinearToNonUniform(uvLinear);
```

To convert a UV coordinate in non-uniform raster screen space to linear screen space, use the following:

```
uvLinear = FoveatedRemapNonUniformToLinear(uvNonUniform);
```

### Update effects

To update effects, such as Gaussian blur, use the following:

```
uvNonUniform = FoveatedRemapDensity(uvLinear);
```

## Update Shader Graph effects

The Screen Position node in Shader Graph provides coordinates that are often used to sample textures affected by foveated rendering. The **Mode** setting of this Shader Graph node determines the form in which the coordinates are provided. In most modes, the coordinate space is non-uniform when rendering with VRR. The **Raw** mode, in contrast, is linear in all cases.

| - | **UV coordinate space** | **UV coordinate space** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Screen Position Mode** | Variable Rate Shading (VRS) and non-foveated rendering | Variable Rate Rasterization (VRR) |
| **Default** | linear | non-uniform |
| **Raw** | linear | **linear** |
| **Center** | linear | non-uniform |
| **Tiled** | linear | non-uniform |
| **Pixel** | linear | non-uniform |

If you use the Screen Position node’s **Raw** mode to sample a non-uniform texture, then the results will be incorrect.

To illustrate the situation, consider a Shader Graph with a Screen Position node connected to a Scene Depth node which, in turn, is connected to the base color of a fragment shader.

This shader renders colors according to the depth values in the scene depth buffer. This shader works correctly under foveated rendering because it uses the **Default** mode Screen Position node, which returns its results in the same space as the depth buffer (and most other Engine-created textures). If you changed the mode to **Raw**, however, the results would no longer be correct when foveated rendering is active on a platform that uses variable rate rasterization.

In the following example, the left image shows the shader on a **quad** and using the correct coordinate space to sample the scene depth buffer. The right image shows foveated rendering using the wrong coordinate space for the sampled texture – notice how the sampled texture no longer lines up with the scene geometry:

*Correct (left) versus mismatched (right) sampling.*

If your Shader Graph depends on the Raw screen position and can’t use any of the other modes, you can use the Shader functions for foveated rendering inside a Custom Function node to remap the raw coordinates (which must be normalized):

```
#include_with_pragmas "Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.core/ShaderLibrary/FoveatedRenderingKeywords.hlsl"
#include "Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.core/ShaderLibrary/FoveatedRendering.hlsl"

// The Raw mode screenPosition must first be normalized: position.xy/position.ww
void CorrectedScreenPosition_float(float4 screenPosition, out float2 correctedScreenPosition)
{
    correctedScreenPosition = FoveatedRemapLinearToNonUniform(screenPosition);
}
```

**Note:** You must create the Custom Function node to reference a file in this case, because if you use the String Type the `#include` statements would be inside the function body and result in syntax errors.

For example, the following Shader Graph routes the Raw coordinates through two Custom Function nodes:

The first custom function normalizes the raw coordinates by dividing the x and y elements by the w element (`B = A.xy/A.ww`). The second custom function uses `FoveatedRemapLinearToNonUniform` to map the linear coordinates to the non-uniform space when required. Recall that when foveated rendering is off or the current platform does not use VRR for foveated rendering, then `FoveatedRemapLinearToNonUniform` returns the linear coordinates unchanged. Thus the shader samples the scene depth correctly in all situations.
