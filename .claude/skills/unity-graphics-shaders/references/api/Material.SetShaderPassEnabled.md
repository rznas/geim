### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| passName | Shader pass name (case insensitive). |
| enabled | Flag indicating whether this Shader pass should be enabled. |

### Description

Enables or disables a Shader pass on a per-Material level.

By default, all Shader passes are enabled. This function allows a Material to treat a specific Shader pass (as indicated by LightMode pass tag) as if it does not exist in the Shader. For example, if the Shader has a "refraction" pass but you only want to enable it on Materials that have a refraction Texture assigned, pass "refraction" as `passName` and false for `enabled` for Materials without a refraction Texture assigned.
