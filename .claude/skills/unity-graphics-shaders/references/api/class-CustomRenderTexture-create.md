# Create a Custom Render Texture

To assign a compatible material to a Custom **Render Texture** asset:

1. To create a Custom Render Texture, go to **Assets** > **Create** > **Rendering** > **Custom Render Texture**.
2. Assign a compatible Material to it in the **Material** property in the **Custom Render Texture** asset.

This Material updates the content of a texture according to its parameters.

## Chaining Custom Render Textures

You can chain Custom Render Textures together. To do this, use a Custom Render Texture as the input for a material that you have assigned to the **Material** or **Initialization Mode > Texture** in another Custom Render Texture.

You can use chained Custom Render Textures to generate a simulation with multiple steps.

Chained Custom Render Textures are dependent on each other. Unity calculates this dependency automatically so that each update happens in the right order. It does this by looking at the materials assigned to the **Material** and **Initialization Mode > Texture** properties in the **Custom Render Textures** inspector window.
