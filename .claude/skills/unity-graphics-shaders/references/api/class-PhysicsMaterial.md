# Physics Material asset reference

The ****Physics Material**** is a material asset that you can place on a **GameObject**. The material defines properties on the **collider**’s surface, such as friction and bounciness.

To create a Physics Material, go to **Assets** > **Create** > **Physics Material**, then drag the Physics Material from the Project window onto a collider in the scene.

If there is no Physics Material set, a collider uses the default surface settings. To adjust the project’s default settings, use the Physics Settings.

| **Property** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Dynamic Friction** | Define how much friction the collider’s surface has against another collider when the colliders are moving or sliding against each other. This value is between 0 and 1. A value of 0 means no friction (like ice), while a value of 1 means very high friction (like rubber). By default, **Dynamic Friction** is set to 0.6.   Unity uses the friction value of both touching colliders to calculate the friction between them, based on the **Friction Combine** property (below). |
| **Static Friction** | Define how much friction the collider’s surface has against another collider when the colliders are not moving. This value is between 0 and 1. A value of 0 means no friction (like ice), while a value of 1 means very high friction (like rubber). By default, **Static Friction** is set to 0.6.   Unity uses the friction value of both touching colliders to calculate the friction between them, based on the **Friction Combine** property (below). |
| **Bounciness** | Define how bouncy the surface is, and how much other colliders can bounce off it. A value of 0 means the surface is not at all bouncy (like soft clay), and other colliders lose kinetic energy upon hitting it. A value of 1 means the surface is very bouncy (like rubber), and other colliders bounce without any loss of kinetic energy. By default, **Bounciness** is set to 0.   Unity uses the bounciness value of both touching colliders to calculate the bounce between them, based on the **Bounce Combine** property.   Note that the physics system’s bounce approximations might still add small amounts of energy to the simulation. |
| **Friction Combine** | Define how the physics system calculates friction between two colliders, based on each collider’s friction. This selection applies to both **Dynamic Friction** and Static Friction. By default, **Friction Combine** is set to **Average**. For details, refer to How collider surface values combine. |
| **Bounce Combine** | Define how the physics system calculates bounce between two colliders, based on each collider’s **Bounciness** value. By default, **Bounce Combine** is set to **Average**. For details, refer to How collider surface values combine. |
