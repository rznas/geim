# Create a material variant

Create a material that inherits properties from a parent material. For more information, refer to Material variants.

You can create a material variant from any material, including Shader Graph materials and [Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com) materials.

## Create a new material variant

1. In the **Project** window, right-click on a material. This material becomes the parent material.
2. Select **Create** > **Rendering** > **Material Variant**.

Unity gives the material variant the same name as the parent material followed by **Variant**.

## Add a parent material to an existing material

1. In the **Project** window, select the material you want to use as a parent.
2. Drag the material onto the material you want to convert into a material variant.

The receiving material becomes a variant of the parent material.

Parent materials can have multiple child materials.

## Change the parent of a material variant

To change the parent of a material variant, also known as reparenting, use one of the following methods:

- In the **Project** window, drag the new parent material onto the material variant.
- Select the material variant, then use the foldout (triangle) at the top-right to open the **Material Hierarchy** window. To set the parent material, select the **Parent** picker (**⊙**).    The Inspector window of a material with the foldout at the top-right selected, and the **Material Hierarchy** window open with the **Parent** property.

A dialog appears to warn you if you try to create a circular dependency.

## Convert a material variant back to a material

To remove the parent from a material variant so it becomes a regular material again, follow these steps:

1. In the **Project** window, select the material variant.
2. In the ****Inspector**** window, open the **More** (**⋮**) menu next to the material name.
3. Select **Flatten Material Variant**.

You can also open the **Material Hierarchy** window, then select **Material** in the dropdown.

## Delete a material variant

To delete a material variant, follow these steps:

1. In the **Project** window, select the material variant.
2. Press the **Delete** key.

If the material variant has child materials, a dialog appears. Select one of the following options:

- **Delete and reparent children** to automatically reassign the child materials to their closest ancestor, unless the material variant was at the top of the hierarchy.
- **Delete only** to delete the material variant without reassigning its child materials. Any child material left without a parent is invalid and will not load correctly at runtime.
