# Check whether a GameObject is compatible with the SRP Batcher in URP

## GameObject compatibility

In any given **scene**, some **GameObjects** are compatible with the SRP Batcher, and some aren’t. Compatible GameObjects use the SRP Batcher code path, and non-compatible GameObjects use the standard SRP code path. For more information, see How the SRP Batcher works.

A GameObject must meet the following requirements to be compatible with the SRP Batcher code path:

- The GameObject must contain either a **mesh** or a skinned mesh. It can’t be a **particle**.
- The GameObject mustn’t use MaterialPropertyBlocks.
- The **shader** that the GameObject uses must be compatible with the SRP Batcher. For more information, see Shader compatibility.

## Shader compatibility

All lit and unlit shaders in the the Universal **Render Pipeline** (URP) and the High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP) fit this requirement (except for the particle versions of these shaders).

For a custom shader to be compatible with the SRP Batcher it must meet the following requirements:

- The shader must declare all built-in engine properties in a single constant buffer named `UnityPerDraw`. For example, `unity_ObjectToWorld`, or `unity_SHAr`.
- The shader must declare all material properties in a single constant buffer named `UnityPerMaterial`.

You can check the compatibility status of a shader in the **Inspector** panel.
