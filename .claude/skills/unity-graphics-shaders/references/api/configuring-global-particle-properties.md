# Configuring global particle properties

The **Particle** System’s Main module contains global properties that affect the whole system. Most of these properties control the initial state of newly created particles.

The system emits particles for a specific duration, and can be set to emit continuously using the **Looped** property. This allows you to set particles to be emitted intermittently or continuously; for example, an object may emit smoke in short puffs or in a steady stream.

The **Start** properties (**lifetime**, **speed**, **size**, **rotation** and **color**) specify the state of a particle on emission. You can specify a particle’s width, height and depth independently, using the **3D Start Size** property (see Non-uniform particle scaling, below).

All **Particle Systems** use the same gravity vector specified in the **Physics** settings. The Gravity Multiplier value can be used to scale the gravity, or switch it off if set to zero.

## Non-uniform particle scaling

The 3D Start Size property allows you to specify a particle’s width, height and depth independently. In the Particle System **Main** module, check the **3D Start Size** checkbox, and enter the values for the initial x (width), y (height) and z (depth) of the particle. Note that z (depth) only applies to 3D **Mesh** particles. You can also set randomised values for these properties, in a range between two constants or curves.

You can set the particle’s initial size in the Particle System **Main** module, and its size over the particle’s lifetime using the **Separate Axes** option in the **Size over Lifetime** module. You can also set the particle’s size in relation to its speed using the **Separate Axes** option in the **Size by Speed** module.

## Simulation Space

The **Simulation Space** property determines whether the particles move with the Particle System parent object, a custom object, or independently in the game world. For example, systems like clouds, hoses and flamethrowers need to be set independently of their parent **GameObject**, as they tend to leave trails that persist in the world space even if the object producing them moves around. On the other hand, if particles are used to create a spark between two electrodes, the particles should move along with the parent object. For more advanced control over how particles follow their Transform, see documentation on the Inherit Velocity module.

When set to Custom, particles no longer move relative to their own **Transform component**. Instead, they all move relative to the movement of the specified Transform component. The Particle System uses the Custom Transform to calculate emitter velocity, which the Inherit Velocity module and **Rate over Distance** property of the Emission module use to control particle velocity and emission.
