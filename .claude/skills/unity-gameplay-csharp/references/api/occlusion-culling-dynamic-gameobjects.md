# Cull moving GameObjects

GameObjects can be static, or dynamic (not static). Static **GameObjects** and dynamic GameObjects behave differently in Unity’s **occlusion culling** system:

- Unity can bake static GameObjects into the occlusion culling data as a Static Occluder and/or a Static Occludee.
- Unity cannot bake dynamic GameObjects into the occlusion culling data. A dynamic GameObject can be an occludee at runtime, but it cannot be an occluder.

To determine whether a dynamic GameObject acts as a occludee, you can set the Dynamic Occlusion property on any type of Renderer component. When Dynamic Occlusion is enabled, Unity culls the Renderer when a Static Occluder blocks it from a **Camera**’s view. When Dynamic Occlusion is disabled, Unity does not cull the Renderer when a Static Occluder blocks it from a Camera’s view.

Dynamic Occlusion is enabled by default. You might want to disable Dynamic Occlusion to achieve specific effects, such as drawing an outline around a character who is behind a wall.

If you are certain that Unity should never apply occlusion culling to a particular GameObject, you can disable Dynamic Occlusion to save on runtime calculations and reduce CPU usage. The per-GameObject impact of these calculations is very small, but at sufficient scale this might benefit performance.

With the Umbra occlusion system, the GPU Resident Drawer treats all objects as if dynamic occlusion were enabled while also providing its own GPU-based occlusion culling mechanism.
