### Description

Interface for receiving callbacks before serialization and after deserialization, to process datatypes that can't otherwise be serialized or deserialized.

The Unity serializer can automatically serialize most data types, but not all of them. In cases where a data type can't be serialized, you can use the serialization callbacks defined in this interface to manually process the data into a serializable form. For more information on when and why manual processing is necessary, refer to Custom serialization.

Unity invokes `OnBeforeSerialize` just before an object is serialized. Inside this callback, you can transform your data into something Unity understands just before Unity serializes it. After the callback is complete, Unity serializes the arrays.

Unity invokes `OnAfterDeserialize` after an object is deserialized. After Unity has written the data to your fields, use this callback to transform the deserialized data back into the form you want it to have at runtime.

Work performed in these callbacks must be done with care, as the Unity serializer runs on a different thread from most of the Unity API. It's recommended to process only fields that are directly owned by the object, to keep the processing burden as low as possible.

This interface supports serialization as reference, such as on objects decorated with the SerializeReference attribute. The order of callback execution between these objects isn't guaranteed. However, the following execution orders are guaranteed:

- `OnBeforeSerialize` is called on the host object before it's called on any of the host object's managed references.
- `OnAfterDeserialize` is called on the host object before it's called on any of the host object's managed references.

For a full explanation of the `SerializeReference` attribute's behaviour, refer to SerializeReference. For more information on when and how Unity performs serialization, refer to Script serialization in the Manual.

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;public class SerializationCallbackScript : MonoBehaviour, ISerializationCallbackReceiver
{
    public List<int> keys = new List<int> { 3, 4, 5 };
    public List<string> values = new List<string> { "I", "Love", "Unity" };    // Create a Dictionary. The Unity serializer doesn't support Dictionary types.
    public Dictionary<int, string>  myDictionary = new Dictionary<int, string>();    public void OnBeforeSerialize()
    {
        keys.Clear();
        values.Clear();
        // For each key/value pair in the dictionary, add the key to the keys list and the value to the values list
        foreach (var kvp in myDictionary)
        {
            keys.Add(kvp.Key);
            values.Add(kvp.Value);
        }
    }    public void OnAfterDeserialize()
    {
        myDictionary = new Dictionary<int, string>();
        // Loop through the list of keys and values and add each key/value pair to the dictionary
        for (int i = 0; i != Math.Min(keys.Count, values.Count); i++)
            myDictionary.Add(keys[i], values[i]);
    }    void OnGUI()
    {
        // This callback displays the following output on three separate labels in the GameView:
        // "Key: 3 value: I"
        // "Key: 4 value: Love"
        // "Key: 5 value: Unity"
        foreach (var kvp in myDictionary)
            GUILayout.Label("Key: " + kvp.Key + " value: " + kvp.Value);
    }
}
```

### Public Methods

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| OnAfterDeserialize | Implement this callback to transform data back into runtime data types after an object is deserialized. |
| OnBeforeSerialize | Implement this callback to transform data into serializable data types immediately before an object is serialized. |
