# XR input options

The main options to handle input in an XR game or application include:

- The XR Interaction Toolkit
- OpenXR interaction profiles
- “Traditional” input through the Input System or Input Manager
- The XR.InputDevice and XR.Node APIs
- Third-party input libraries

In some cases, you might use more than one of these options at the same time. For example, you could use the XR Interaction Toolkit to allow the user to pick up objects in the environment, use the Input System to bind a pause function to a controller button, and use the XR.Node API to read the hardware state so that you can animate the controller GameObject.

**Note:** The OpenXR plug-in, which supports many different XR devices and controllers, provides its own, additional way to access XR input and tracking data. You can still use the XR Interaction Toolkit, the Input System, or the `XR.InputDevice` and `XR.Node` APIs. (The legacy Input Manager is not supported when you use the OpenXR plugin.) Refer to Input in Unity OpenXR for more information.

### XR Interaction Toolkit

The XR Interaction Toolkit builds on the Input System and the base `UnityEngine.XR` API to support XR input and interaction. It provides a near ready-to-use set of components for handling XR input and defining interactions between the user and the environment and the scene UI.

The XR Interaction Toolkit provides:

- Interactors: objects in the scene that allow the user to interact with scene GameObjects. Typically driven by XR controllers or the user’s hands.
- Interactables: objects in the scene that the user can interact with (using an interactor).
- UI interaction: supports interaction with Unity’s built-in UI elements.
- Locomotion: supports various modes of locomotion, including continuous movement, teleportation, and climbing.

### Input System or Input Manager

You can access the controls of XR Controllers, such as buttons and joysticks, in the same ways you would access any game controller. To access tracking data, use the XR.InputTracking API in code. You can also use the Input System TrackedPoseDriver component to control a GameObject with a tracked device such as a HMD or controller. The TrackedPoseDriver component is also available from the Legacy Input Helpers package, in case you are not using the Input System.

**Note:** When you use the OpenXR plug-in, you must use the Input System. The Input Manager is not supported.

### XR Hand tracking input

The [XR Hands](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.hands@1.7/) package provides access to hand tracking data from XR devices that support it. To access this data, you must also use an XR provider plug-in that has been updated to support hand tracking, such as [OpenXR version 1.12](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.openxr@1.12/).

The XR Hands package provides the following:

- The XRHandTrackingSubsystem which allows an XR device to send hand data to a Unity app.
- A hand tracking API Unity apps can use to access the data.
- Support for the OpenXR Meta Aim Hand feature extension, which provides a gesture aiming system along with OpenXR input bindings for hand tracking data.

### visionOS input

Your input options on visionOS depend on whether your app is running in windowed mode, mixed reality mode, or virtual reality mode.

In windowed mode, the user’s gaze and pinch gestures are translated into touch events by the operating system. Your app doesn’t have access to the raw input data. visionOS reports a maximum of two touch points.

In mixed reality mode, the input options further depend on whether your app is running in a shared space with other apps or in an immersive space. In a shared space, the situation is similar to that of a windowed app; the operating system translates the user’s gaze and hand movements into touch gestures. In this case, you can use the Spatial Pointer Device to access 3D touch data rather than just 2D. In an immersive space, you also have access to 3D ray origin and direction of the user’s gaze at the start of the gesture. In addition, you have access to ARKit data such as head and hand tracking, plane detection, scene reconstruction meshes, and image tracking.

In virtual reality mode, you have access to ARKit data such as head and hand tracking, plane detection, scene reconstruction meshes, and image tracking. (You do not have access to the **Spatial Pointer Device** or other PolySpatial-specific components.)

For more information, refer to PolySpatial visionOS: Input.

### XR Input APIs

The XR Input APIs provide direct access to XR input. The API lets you find connected XR devices and read their tracking data and state of their input hardware.

Refer to Unity XR Input for more information about the XR input API.

### Third-party input APIs

Device makers and other third parties often provide their own input and interaction APIs that you can use instead of or in addition to those provided by Unity.
