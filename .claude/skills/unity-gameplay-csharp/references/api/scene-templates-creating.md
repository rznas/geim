# Creating scene templates

You can create a new **scene** template in one of the following ways:

- Start an empty template.
- Create a template from an existing scene asset.
- Create a template from the current scene.

After you create a template, you can edit its properties or create new scenes from it.

| **Tip:** |
| --- |
| Before you create a template from a scene, create a folder with the same name as the scene, and put any assets you want to clone in it. When you create the template, Unity automatically enables the **Clone** property for those assets. For details, see Editing scene templates. |

## Creating an empty scene template

You can create empty scene templates and configure them later. An empty template does not appear in the New Scene dialog until you edit its properties to associate a scene asset to it.

To create an empty scene template in the current project folder:

- From the menu, select **Assets > Create > Scene Template**.

To create an empty scene template in a specific project folder:

1. Do one of the following:
2. In the **Project window**, right-click the folder to open the context menu.
3. Open the folder in the Project window, and right-click the asset pane to open the context menu.
4. Select **Create > Scene Template**.

## Creating a template from an existing scene asset

You can turn any existing scene into a scene template. After you create a template from an existing scene, you might want to edit its properties to specify which of its dependencies Unity clones when you create a new scene from it.

To create a template from an existing scene asset, open the Project window, and do one of the following:

- Right-click a scene asset to open the context menu. Then select **Create > Scene Template From Scene**.
- Select the scene asset, and from the main menu, select **Assets > Create > Scene Template From Scene**.

## Creating a template from the current scene

To create a scene template from the current scene, from the menu, select **File > Save As Scene Template**.

If you have unsaved changes, Unity prompts you to save the scene before it saves the template.

After you create a template from the current scene, you might want to edit its properties to specify which of its dependencies Unity clones when you create a new scene from it.

## Creating templates from C# scripts

You can create scene templates from your C# **scripts**.

To create an empty scene template, use the **CreateSceneTemplate** method.

```
SceneTemplate.CreateSceneTemplate(string sceneTemplatePath)
```

To create a template from an existing scene, use the **CreateTemplateFromScene** method. Unity automatically associates the scene with the template, and extracts the scene’s dependencies.

```
SceneTemplate.CreateTemplateFromScene(SceneAsset sourceSceneAsset, string sceneTemplatePath);
```
