# Yield instruction reference

Coroutines suspend their execution at a `yield return` statement. A `yield return null` suspends execution of the coroutine until the next frame. But the `yield return` can also return an instruction for the Unity Editor or runtime to, for example, wait for a specified amount of time or until a condition is met before resuming execution of the coroutine.

## Runtime yield instructions

Unity has a set of custom yield instructions derived from `UnityEngine.YieldInstruction` that you can use to resume after a specified time, when a specified conditions is met, or at specific points in the Player loop.

| Instruction | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `AsyncOperation` | Suspends a coroutine and resumes when an asynchronous operation completes, such as loading a **scene** or asset. |
| `WaitForEndOfFrame` | Suspends a coroutine and resumes at the end of the frame, after all rendering and GUI events.    **Note**: `WaitForEndOfFrame` never runs in Edit mode when the Editor is in batch mode, even if scripts are marked with `[ExecuteInEditMode]` or `[ExecuteAlways]`. |
| `WaitForFixedUpdate` | Suspends a coroutine and resumes at the end of the next physics update, after all physics calculations. |
| `WaitForSeconds` | Suspends a coroutine and resumes after a specified number of seconds, taking the time scale into account. |
| `WaitForSecondsRealtime` | Suspends a coroutine and resumes after a specified number of seconds, ignoring the time scale. |
| `WaitUntil` | Suspends a coroutine and resumes when a supplied delegate evaluates to `true`. |
| `WaitWhile` | Suspends a coroutine and resumes when a supplied delegate evaluates to `false`. |

For more information and example usage of these yield instructions, refer to their API reference pages.

For a visual representation of where different coroutines resume in the Player loop, refer to the diagram in Event function execution order.

## UnityTest yield instructions

Unity Test Framework tests marked with the `[UnityTest]` attribute run as coroutines. The Test Framework package adds support for additional yield instructions to control the Unity Editor from tests and provides the possibility to define custom yield instructions.

| Instruction | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `EnterPlayMode` | Creates a yield instruction for the Unity Editor to enter Play mode. |
| `ExitPlayMode` | Creates a yield instruction for the Unity Editor to exit Play mode. |
| `RecompileScripts` | Triggers a recompilation of **scripts** in the Unity Editor. |
| `WaitForDomainReload` | Delays the execution of scripts until after an incoming domain reload. |

For more information on the yield instructions provided by Unity Test Framework, refer to Yield instructions for the Editor.

## Editor yield instructions

The Editor coroutines package adds support for coroutines that run in the Unity Editor’s Edit mode. The package includes additional yield instructions for Edit mode coroutines.

| Instruction | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `EditorWaitForSeconds` | Resumes an EditorCoroutine after a specified number of seconds, taking the time scale into account. |

For more information, refer to [Editor coroutines](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.editorcoroutines@latest).

## Batch mode support

All runtime coroutine yield instructions run as normal when you run a standalone Player in batch mode.

If you run the Editor in batch mode and your project has scripts marked with `[ExecuteInEditMode]` or `[ExecuteAlways]` so that they also run in Edit mode, all runtime coroutines in those scripts run in Edit mode except for `WaitForEndOfFrame`. This is because not all Unity subsystems update as regularly in Edit mode as they do at runtime. For more information, refer to the `[ExecuteAlways]` API reference.
