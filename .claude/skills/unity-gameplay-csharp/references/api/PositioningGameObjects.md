# Position GameObjects

To alter the Transform component of the **GameObject**, use the mouse to manipulate any **Gizmo** axis, or type values directly into the number fields of the **Transform** component in the **Inspector**.

Alternatively, you can select each of the five **Transform** modes from the **Scene** view’s Tools Overlay or with a hotkey:

- **W** for Move
- **E** for Rotate
- **R** for Scale
- **T** for RectTransform
- **Y** for Transform

## Move

At the center of the **Move** Gizmo, there are three small squares you can use to drag the GameObject within a single plane (meaning you can move two axes at once while the third keeps still).

If you hold shift while clicking and dragging in the center of the Move Gizmo, the center of the Gizmo changes to a flat square. The flat square indicates that you can move the GameObject around on a plane relative to the direction the **Scene view** **Camera** is facing.

## Rotate

With the **Rotate** tool selected, change the GameObject’s rotation by clicking and dragging the axes of the wireframe sphere Gizmo that appears around it. As with the Move Gizmo, the last axis you changed will be colored yellow. Think of the red, green and blue circles as performing rotation around the red, green and blue axes that appear in the Move mode (red is the x-axis, green in the y-axis, and blue is the z-axis). Finally, use the outermost circle to rotate the GameObject around the Scene view z-axis. Think of this as rotating in screen space.

## Scale

The **Scale** tool lets you rescale the GameObject evenly on all axes at once by clicking and dragging on the cube at the center of the Gizmo. You can also scale the axes individually, but you should take care if you do this when there are child GameObjects, because the effect can look quite strange.

## RectTransform

The RectTransform is commonly used for positioning 2D elements such as **Sprites** or UI elements, but it can also be useful for manipulating 3D GameObjects. It combines moving, scaling and rotation into a single Gizmo:

- Click and drag within the rectangular Gizmo to move the GameObject.
- Click and drag any corner or edge of the rectangular Gizmo to scale the GameObject.
- Drag an edge to scale the GameObject along one axis.
- Drag a corner to scale the GameObject on two axes.
- To rotate the GameObject, position your cursor just beyond a corner of the rectangle. The cursor changes to display a rotation icon. Click and drag from this area to rotate the GameObject.

Note that in 2D mode, you can’t change the z-axis in the Scene using the Gizmos. However, it is useful for certain scripting techniques to use the z-axis for other purposes, so you can still set the z-axis using the Transform component in the Inspector.

For more information on transforming GameObjects, see documentation on the Transform Component.

## Transform

The **Transform** tool combines the **Move**, **Rotate** and **Scale** tools. Its Gizmo provides handles for movement and rotation. When the **Tool Handle Rotation** is set to **Local** (see below), the Transform tool also provides handles for scaling the selected GameObject.

## Gizmo handle position toggles

The **Gizmo handle position toggles** found in the Tool Settings Overlay are used to define the location of any Transform tool Gizmo, and the handles used to manipulate the Gizmo itself.

### For position

Use the dropdown menu to switch between **Pivot** and **Center**.

- **Pivot** positions the Gizmo at the actual pivot point of the GameObject, as defined by the Transform component.
- **Center** positions the Gizmo at a center position based on the selected GameObjects.

### For rotation

Use the dropdown menu to switch between **Local**, **Global**, and **Grid**.

- **Local** keeps the Gizmo’s rotation relative to the GameObject’s.
- **Global** clamps the Gizmo to world space orientation.
- **Grid** clamps the Gizmo to the rotation of the grid.

## Snapping

Unity provides three types of snapping:

- World grid snapping: Snap a GameObject to a grid projected along the X, Y, or Z axes or transform a GameObject in increments along the X, Y, or Z axes. This is only available while using the Global or Grid handle orientation.
- Surface snapping: Snap the GameObject to the intersection of any **Collider**.
- Vertex snapping: Snap any vertex from a given **Mesh** to the position of another Mesh’s vertex or surface. You can snap vertex to vertex, vertex to surface, and pivot to vertex.

When you drag a **Prefab** into a scene, Unity places them at the cursor position by default. You can preserve any offsets in the Prefab in relation to the cursor position by holding the **Alt** key while dragging a Prefab.

### Surface snapping

To snap a GameObject to the intersection of a Collider, do the following:

1. Make sure the **Move** tool is active.
2. Hold **Shift+Ctrl** (macOS: **Shift+Command**), then click and hold a GameObject’s tool handle.
3. Drag the GameObject on to another GameObject with a Collider.

### Vertex snapping

Use **vertex snapping** to quickly assemble your Scenes: take any vertex from a given Mesh and place that vertex in the same position as any vertex from any other Mesh you choose. For example, use vertex snapping to align road sections precisely in a racing game, or to position power-up items at the vertices of a Mesh.

Follow the steps below to use vertex snapping:

1. Select the Mesh you want to manipulate and make sure the **Move** tool is active.
2. Press and hold the **V** key to activate the vertex snapping mode.
3. Move your cursor over the vertex on your Mesh that you want to use as the pivot point.
4. Hold down the left mouse button once your cursor is over the vertex you want and drag your Mesh next to any other vertex on another Mesh.
  - To snap a vertex to a surface on another Mesh, add and hold **Shift+Ctrl** (macOS: **Shift+Command**) while you move over the surface you want to snap to.
  - To snap the pivot to a vertex on another Mesh, add and hold **Shift** while you move the cursor to the vertex you want to snap to.
5. Release the mouse button and the **V** key when you are happy with the results (**Shift+V** acts as a toggle of this functionality).

## Rotate a GameObject towards a point on a collider

Use look-at rotation to rotate a GameObject towards a point on the surface of a collider. This is useful to orient GameObjects towards a target, such as a camera or player.

To use look-at rotation:

1. In the Scene view, select the GameObject you want to rotate.
2. In the Tools overlay, select the **Rotate** tool or press **E**.
3. Click the rotate Gizmo handle to select it.
4. Hold **Shift+Ctrl** (macOS: **Shift+Command**) and move your mouse over the surface of a collider you want to rotate the selected GameObject towards.

## Screen Space Transform

While using the **Transform** tool, hold down the **Shift** key to enable Screen Space mode. This mode allows you to move, rotate and scale GameObjects as they appear on the screen, rather than in the Scene.
