# Introduction to instantiating prefabs

You can use prefabs to instantiate complicated **GameObjects** or collections of GameObjects at runtime. Compared with creating GameObjects from scratch using code, instantiating prefabs using code has many advantages because you can do the following:

- Instantiate a prefab using one line of code. Creating equivalent GameObjects from scratch requires many more lines of code.
- Change which prefab is instantiated without changing the code. You can make a simple rocket into a super-charged rocket, without any code changes.

## Common scenarios

Instantiating prefabs at runtime is useful in the following common scenarios:

- Building a structure out of a single prefab by replicating it multiple times in different positions, for example in a grid or circle formation.
- Firing a projectile prefab from a launcher. The projectile prefab can be a complex configuration containing a **mesh**, **Rigidbody**, **collider**, **audio source**, dynamic light, and a child GameObject with its own trail **Particle** System.
- A vehicle, building, or character, for example a robot, breaking apart into many pieces. In this scenario, the example script deletes and replaces the complete, operational robot prefab with a wrecked robot prefab. This wrecked prefab consists of separate broken parts of the robot, each set up with Rigidbody components and **Particle Systems** of their own. This technique allows you to blow up a robot into many pieces with just one line of code, which replaces the original GameObject with a wrecked prefab.

## Instantiate a prefab

To instantiate a prefab at runtime, your code needs a reference to the prefab. To make this reference, you can create a public field of type `GameObject` in your code, then assign the prefab you want to use to this field in the **Inspector**.

The following script example has a single public variable, `myPrefab`, which is a reference to a prefab. It creates an instance of that prefab in the `Start` method.

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
public class InstantiationExample : MonoBehaviour 
{
    // Reference to the prefab. Drag a prefab into this field in the Inspector.
    public GameObject myPrefab;

    // This script will simply instantiate the prefab when the game starts.
    void Start()
    {
        // Instantiate at position (0, 0, 0) and zero rotation.
        Instantiate(myPrefab, new Vector3(0, 0, 0), Quaternion.identity);
    }
}
```

To use this example:

1. Create a new MonoBehaviour script in your Project, and name it `InstantiationExample`.
2. Copy the code and paste it into your new script, and save it.
3. Create an empty GameObject using the menu **GameObject** > **Create Empty**.
4. Add the script to the new GameObject as a component by dragging it onto the empty GameObject.
5. Create any prefab, and drag it from the ****Project window**** into the **My Prefab** field in the script component.

When you enter Play mode, the prefab instantiates at position (0 , 0 , 0) in the **scene**.

You can drag a different prefab into the **My Prefab** field in the **Inspector** window to change which prefab Unity instantiates, without having to change the script.
