# Audio Echo Filter

The **Audio Echo Filter** repeats a sound after a given **Delay**, attenuating the repetitions based on the **Decay Ratio**.

## Properties

| ***Property:*** | ***Function:*** |
| --- | --- |
| **Delay** | Echo delay in ms. 10 to 5000. Default = 500. |
| **Decay Ratio** | Echo decay per delay. 0 to 1. 1.0 = No decay, 0.0 = total decay (ie simple 1 line delay). Default = 0.5.L |
| **Wet Mix** | Volume of echo signal to pass to output. 0.0 to 1.0. Default = 1.0. |
| **Dry Mix** | Volume of original signal to pass to output. 0.0 to 1.0. Default = 1.0. |

## Details

The **Wet Mix** value determines the amplitude of the filtered signal, where the **Dry Mix** determines the amplitude of the unfiltered sound output.

Hard surfaces reflects the propagation of sound. For example a large canyon can be made more convincing with the Audio Echo Filter.

Sound propagates slower than light - we all know that from lightning and thunder. To simulate this, add an Audio Echo Filter to an event sound, set the Wet Mix to 0.0 and modulate the Delay to the distance between AudioSource and AudioListener.
