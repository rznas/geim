# Audio High Pass Effect

The **Highpass Effect** passes high frequencies of an AudioMixer group and cuts off signals with frequencies lower than the **Cutoff Frequency**.

## Properties

| ***Property:*** | ***Function:*** |
| --- | --- |
| **Cutoff freq** | Highpass cutoff frequency in Hertz (range 10.0 to 22000.0, default = 5000.0). |
| **Resonance** | Highpass resonance quality value (range 1.0 to 10.0, default = 1.0). |

## Details

The **Resonance** (short for Highpass Resonance Quality Factor) determines how much the filter’s self-resonance is dampened. Higher highpass resonance quality indicates a lower rate of energy loss, that is the oscillations die out more slowly.
