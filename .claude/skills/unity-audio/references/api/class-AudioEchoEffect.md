# Audio Echo Effect

The **Audio Echo Effect** repeats a sound after a given **Delay**, attenuating the repetitions based on the **Decay Ratio**.

## Properties

| ***Property:*** | ***Function:*** |
| --- | --- |
| **Delay** | Echo delay in ms. 10 to 5000. Default = 500. |
| **Decay** | Echo decay per delay. 0 to 100%. 100% = No decay, 0% = total decay (ie simple 1 line delay). Default = 50%. |
| **Max channels** | Maximum number of supported channels from 0 to 16 (default = 0). |
| **Drymix** | Volume of original signal to pass to output. 0 to 100%. Default = 100%. |
| **Wetmix** | Volume of echo signal to pass to output. 0 to 100%. Default = 100%. |

## Details

The **Wetmix** value determines the amplitude of the filtered signal, where the **Drymix** determines the amplitude of the unfiltered sound output.

Hard surfaces reflects the propagation of sound. For example a large canyon can be made more convincing with the Audio Echo Filter.
