# Audio Chorus Effect

The **Audio Chorus Effect** takes an Audio Mixer group output and processes it creating a chorus effect.

## Properties

| ***Property:*** | ***Function:*** |
| --- | --- |
| **Dry mix** | Volume of original signal to pass to output. 0.0 to 1.0. Default = 0.5. |
| **Wet mix tap 1** | Volume of 1st chorus tap. 0.0 to 1.0. Default = 0.5. |
| **Wet mix tap 2** | Volume of 2nd chorus tap. This tap is 90 degrees out of phase of the first tap. 0.0 to 1.0. Default = 0.5. |
| **Wet mix tap 3** | Volume of 3rd chorus tap. This tap is 90 degrees out of phase of the second tap. 0.0 to 1.0. Default = 0.5. |
| **Delay** | The LFO’s delay in ms. 0.1 to 100.0. Default = 40.0 ms |
| **Rate** | The LFO’s modulation rate in Hz. 0.0 to 20.0. Default = 0.8 Hz. |
| **Depth** | Chorus modulation depth. 0.0 to 1.0. Default = 0.03. |
| **Feedback** | Chorus feedback. Controls how much of the wet signal gets fed back into the filter’s buffer. 0.0 to 1.0. Default = 0.0. |

## Details

The chorus effect modulates the original sound by a sinusoid low frequency oscillator (LFO). The output sounds like there are multiple sources emitting the same sound with slight variations - resembling a choir.

You can tweak the chorus filter to create a flanger effect by lowering the feedback and decreasing the delay, as the flanger is a variant of the chorus.

Creating a simple, dry echo is done by setting **Rate** and **Depth** to 0 and tweaking the mixes and **Delay**
