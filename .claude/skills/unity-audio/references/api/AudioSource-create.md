# Set up an Audio Source component

Create an audio source to control how an audio clip plays, where it plays and how often.

To create and configure an audio source:

1. Import your audio files.
2. Create an audio source.
3. Assign an audio generator to your audio source.
4. Alter the settings of your audio source.

## Import your audio files

To import your audio files into your Unity project, drag your audio file into your project. Unity imports these files as audio clips. For a list of the audio file formats Unity supports, refer to Audio file compatibility.

## Create an audio source

There are multiple ways to create an audio source. Use one of the following methods:

- Create an audio source from an audio file.
- Create an audio source from an existing GameObject.
- Create an audio source from the menu.

### Create an audio source from an audio file

A quicker way to create an audio source is to click and drag an audio file from your **Project window** into the **scene**.

As a result, Unity automatically creates a **GameObject** with an **Audio Source** component, and assigns your audio file to its **Audio Clip** property.

### Create an audio source from an existing GameObject

If you have a GameObject in your scene you want to add an audio source to:

1. Click on the GameObject.
2. In the **Inspector** window, select **Add Component**.
3. Select **Audio** > **Audio Source**.

As a result, Unity adds an **Audio Source** component to your GameObject.

Another way to do this is to drag an audio file from your Project window onto the GameObject. Unity attaches the clip along with a new audio source if it doesn’t already have one. If the object already has an audio source the new clip will replace the one that the source currently uses.

### Create an audio source from the menu

To create a new audio source from the menu:

1. In the **Hierarchy** tab, select the **Add (+)** button.
2. Select **Audio** > **Audio Source**.

Unity adds a new GameObject that contains an **Audio Source** component to your scene.

## Assign an audio generator to your audio source

If your audio source doesn’t have an audio generator assigned, you need to assign one. To do this:

1. Click on your GameObject that contains the **Audio Source** component. The Inspector window shows.
2. In the Inspector window, on the **Audio Source** component, locate the **Audio Generator** property.
3. Then, do one of the following:
4. Drag an audio clip or audio random container from the Project window to the property.
5. Click the small circle icon to the right of the property, then select a resource from the list.

## Alter the settings of your audio source

If you want to configure your audio source more to your liking, refer to Audio Source component reference.
