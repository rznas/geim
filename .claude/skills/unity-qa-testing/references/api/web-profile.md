# Profile a Web build

Record performance data for Web builds using the Unity Profiler.

To connect a Web build to the Unity Profiler, you can use the temporary local server created during the **Build and Run** process or manually connect to a device using its IP address. Both methods require a **Profile** button in the application. This button is included in the Default and PWA Web templates, but you must add it to all other templates.

**Notes:**

- Profiling is only available for **development builds**.
- Unity can profile basic draw call data for Web applications, but the Frame Debugger doesn’t work on the Web platform.

To profile on a different platform, refer to Collect performance data on a target platform.

## Profile on a temporary local server (automatic connection)

**Note**: The Default and PWA Web templates include a **Profile** button by default. For all other templates, you must Add the Profile button to your template before following these steps.

To profile your Web build on a Unity temporary local server:

1. Open the **Build Profiles** window (menu: **File** > **Build Profiles**).
2. Select **Web** as the target platform.
3. Enable **Development Build**.
4. Enable **Autoconnect Profiler**.
5. Select **Build and Run**. Unity starts a temporary local server and opens the build in your browser. The build automatically connects to the Profiler and starts profiling.
6. To disconnect, in the running build, select **Stop Profiling**.
7. View real-time performance data in the **Profiler** window.

**Tip**: To collect profiling data when the browser window is inactive, in Player Settings (menu: **Edit** > **Project Settings** > **Player**), enable **Run In Background**.

## Profile on another device or server (manual connection)

**Note**: The Default and PWA Web templates include a **Profile** button by default. For all other templates, you must Add the Profile button to your template before following these steps.

To profile your Web build on a custom server or another device:

### Prepare your build

1. Open the **Build Profiles** window (menu: **File** > **Build Profiles**).
2. Select **Web** as the target platform.
3. Enable **Development Build**.
4. Select **Build** or build your project with scripting.

### Connect to the Profiler and collect data

1. Open the Profiler window (menu: **Window** > **Analysis** > **Profiler**).
2. Select **Play Mode** > **Enable Web Profiling**.

    The Enable Web Profiling option in the Profiler window.
3. A window opens showing that web profiling is active. Copy the IP address and port from the window.
4. Run your build. In the running build, select **Profile**.

5. A window opens requesting the connection information. Paste in the IP address and port.
6. To disconnect, in the running build, select **Stop Profiling**.
7. View real-time performance data in the **Profiler** window.

### Collect startup data on another device or server

If your build is running on the same device as the Unity Editor, you can enable the **Autoconnect Profiler** option in the **Build Profiles** window to collect startup data automatically. To use **Autoconnect Profiler** on another device, you must manually add the IP address in the player arguments of your build.

To configure another device to use **Autoconnect Profiler**:

1. Open the `index.html` file of your build.
2. Find the following line: `var config = { arguments: [] // ... }`
3. Modify it to include the IP address and port you copied from the Profiler window, where `xxxxxx` is the IP address and port: `var config = { arguments: ["--player-connection-ip=xxxxxx"], // ... }`
4. Save the `index.html` file and run your build.

## Add the Profile button to a custom Web template

To add the **Profile** button to a custom Web template:

1. In your custom template’s `index.html` file, add the following near the top of the file: `#if DEVELOPMENT_PLAYER <script src="<<<TemplateData/profiler.js>>>"></script> #endif`
2. In the script section where you create the Unity instance, add the following code after the instance is available: `#if DEVELOPMENT_PLAYER var profile = unityProfiler.createButton(unityInstance); profile.style.position = 'fixed'; profile.style.bottom = '5px'; profile.style.left = '5px'; // Adds the Profile button to the body element of the page. // You can change this line to append the button to a different element as needed. document.body.appendChild(profile); #endif`
3. (Recommended) When handling player quit or unload, add the following to remove the **Profile** button and clean up resources: `unityProfiler.shutDown();`

After making these updates, follow the steps to Profile on a temporary local server or Profile on another device or server.
