# Create and manage build profiles

Create and manage **build profiles** to configure your application for multiple platforms.

## Create a build profile

To create a build profile, use the following steps:

1. Navigate to **File** > **Build Profiles**.
2. In the **Build Profiles** window, select **Add Build Profile** to open the **Platform Browser** window. The **Platform Browser** window presents a list of supported platforms that include desktop, mobile, web, and **closed platforms**.
3. In the **Platform Browser** window, select the target platform. If the selected platform isn’t currently installed on your machine, use **Install with Unity Hub** and follow the installation instructions. Before installing any platform modules, refer to the System requirements page.
4. Enter a unique name for the build profile in the **Name** field. The name identifies the build profile in the **Build Profiles** window.
5. Select any recommended packages to install from the **Packages** section. Required packages are automatically selected for installation when creating a build profile from the **Platform Browser**.
6. Select **Add Build Profile**.
7. Select the required platform settings.
8. Select **Switch Profile** to set the new build profile as the active profile. This will attach an **Active** badge to the build profile name.

**Note**: If you plan to deploy your application on a closed platform, check the license requirements. For further information, refer to [Platform Module Installation](https://unity.com/platform-installation).

## Create a build profile from a platform profile

You can duplicate an existing platform profile and create a new build profile from it. To do that, right click the selected platform and select **Copy to new profile**.

## Manage build profiles

To manage build profiles, right-click on any build profile name. These options allow you to do the following:

- Copy to a new build profile.
- Rename a build profile.
- Delete a build profile.

**Note**: There are no limits to how many build profiles you can have in a project.
