# Batch static meshes at build time

To batch static **GameObjects** at build time, enable **static batching**. For more information about batching, refer to Introduction to batching meshes.

Follow these steps:

1. Go to **Edit** > **Project Settings** > **Player**.
2. In **Other Settings**, enable **Static Batching**.
3. In the **Scene** view or **Hierarchy** window, select the GameObject that you want to batch. You can select multiple GameObjects at the same time to enable static batching for all of them.
4. In the ****Inspector**** window, select the Static Editor Flags dropdown and enable **Batching Static**.

If you use static batching at build time, Unity doesn’t use any CPU resources at runtime to generate the **mesh** data for the static batch.

**Note:** Unity uses additional GPU memory to store the combined meshes, even if the meshes are the same. For example, marking trees as static in a dense forest environment can have a large impact on memory. If static batching uses too much memory, combine meshes manually instead.

If a mesh is culled because it’s outside the **camera** view, Unity might not be able to draw all the meshes in a single draw call. This is because the culled mesh leaves a gap in the combined vertex buffers.
