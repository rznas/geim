# Add material properties

To assign material properties to a **Shader** object in **ShaderLab**, you place a `Properties` block inside a `Shader` block.

If you want to access some of those properties in a shader program, you need to declare a Cg/HLSL variable with the same name and a matching type.

For example these shader properties:

```
_MyColor ("Some Color", Color) = (1,1,1,1) 
_MyVector ("Some Vector", Vector) = (0,0,0,0) 
_MyFloat ("My float", Float) = 0.5 
_MyTexture ("Texture", 2D) = "white" {} 
_MyCubemap ("Cubemap", CUBE) = "" {}
```

would be declared for access in Cg/HLSL code as:

```
half4 _MyColor; // low precision type is usually enough for colors
float4 _MyVector;
float _MyFloat; 
sampler2D _MyTexture;
samplerCUBE _MyCubemap;
```

Cg/HLSL can also accept **uniform** keyword, but it is not necessary:

```
uniform float4 _MyColor;
```

Property types in ShaderLab map to Cg/HLSL variable types this way:

- Color and Vector properties map to **float4**, **half4** or **fixed4** variables.
- Range and Float properties map to **float**, **half** or **fixed** variables.
- Texture properties map to **sampler2D** variables for regular (2D) textures; **Cubemaps** map to **samplerCUBE**; and 3D textures map to **sampler3D**.

## Color spaces and color/vector shader data

When using Linear color space, all material color properties are supplied as sRGB colors, but are converted into linear values when passed into shaders.

For example, if your Properties shader block contains a `Color` property called “*MyColor“, then the corresponding ”*MyColor” HLSL variable will get the linear color value.

For properties that are marked as `Float` or `Vector` type, no color space conversions are done by default; it is assumed that they contain non-color data. It is possible to add `[Gamma]` attribute for float/vector properties to indicate that they are specified in sRGB space, just like colors (see Properties).
