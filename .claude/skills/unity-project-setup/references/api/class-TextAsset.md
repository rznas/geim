# Text assets

Text assets are a format for imported text files. When you drop a text file into your `Project` folder, Unity converts it to a Text Asset. The supported text formats are:

- `.bytes`
- `.csv`
- `.fnt`
- `.htm`
- `.html`
- `.json`
- `.md`
- `.txt`
- `.xml`
- `.yaml`

**Note:** When you use `AssetDatabase.FindAssets` with the `t:TextAsset` filter, script files are also considered a text asset, and are included in the results.

If you select a text asset in the **Project window**, the Inspector window displays the text content of the file.

## Using text assets

Text assets are useful for getting text from different text files into your application while you’re building it. For example, you can use it to add a `.txt` file to your project to bring the text into your application. If you’re making a text-heavy adventure game, you can put the text for each **scene** separate `.txt` files and reference the text asset when a character enters the scene.

However, text assets aren’t intended for text file generation at runtime. For that you need to use input/output programming techniques to read and write external files. For more information on the ways you can generate text in Unity, refer to UI systems.

### Binary data

Text assets can also store binary data. If you create a file with the `.bytes` extension, you can load it as a text asset and access it through the `bytes` property.

For example, put a `.jpeg` file into the `Resources` folder and change the extension to `.bytes`, then use the following script code to read the data at runtime:

```
//Load texture from disk
TextAsset bindata = Resources.Load("Texture") as TextAsset;
Texture2D tex = new Texture2D(1,1);
tex.LoadImage(bindata.bytes);
```

Unity treats files with the `.txt` and `.bytes` extension as text and binary files, respectively. Don’t attempt to store a binary file using the `.txt` extension, because it creates unexpected behavior when attempting to read data from it.
