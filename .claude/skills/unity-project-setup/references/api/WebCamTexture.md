### Description

WebCam Textures are textures onto which the live video input is rendered.

On Android, iOS, and WebGL platforms, `WebCamTexture` requires the camera permission. On Android, you can request it at runtime using the Permission API. For more information, refer to Request runtime permissions documentation.

On iOS and WebGL, you can request camera permission at runtime using Application.RequestUserAuthorization.

**Note**: On Android and iOS platforms, Unity doesn't support multiple WebCamTextures simultaneously.

The following code example demonstrates how to request the user for camera permission on iOS, Android, and WebGL platforms.

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using System;
using System.Collections;
using UnityEngine;
#if UNITY_ANDROID
using UnityEngine.Android;
#endifpublic class WebCam : MonoBehaviour
{
#if UNITY_IOS || UNITY_WEBGL
    private bool CheckPermissionAndRaiseCallbackIfGranted(UserAuthorization authenticationType, Action authenticationGrantedAction)
    {
        if (Application.HasUserAuthorization(authenticationType))
        {
            if (authenticationGrantedAction != null)
                authenticationGrantedAction();            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }    private IEnumerator AskForPermissionIfRequired(UserAuthorization authenticationType, Action authenticationGrantedAction)
    {
        if (!CheckPermissionAndRaiseCallbackIfGranted(authenticationType, authenticationGrantedAction))
        {
            yield return Application.RequestUserAuthorization(authenticationType);
            if (!CheckPermissionAndRaiseCallbackIfGranted(authenticationType, authenticationGrantedAction))
                Debug.LogWarning($"Permission {authenticationType} Denied");
        }
    }
#elif UNITY_ANDROID
    private void PermissionCallbacksPermissionGranted(string permissionName)
    {
        StartCoroutine(DelayedCameraInitialization());
    }    private IEnumerator DelayedCameraInitialization()
    {
        yield return null;
        InitializeCamera();
    }    private void PermissionCallbacksPermissionDenied(string permissionName)
    {
        Debug.LogWarning($"Permission {permissionName} Denied");
    }    private void AskCameraPermission()
    {
        var callbacks = new PermissionCallbacks();
        callbacks.PermissionDenied += PermissionCallbacksPermissionDenied;
        callbacks.PermissionGranted += PermissionCallbacksPermissionGranted;
        Permission.RequestUserPermission(Permission.Camera, callbacks);
    }
#endif    void Start()
    {
#if UNITY_IOS || UNITY_WEBGL
        StartCoroutine(AskForPermissionIfRequired(UserAuthorization.WebCam, () => { InitializeCamera(); }));
        return;
#elif UNITY_ANDROID
        if (!Permission.HasUserAuthorizedPermission(Permission.Camera))
        {
            AskCameraPermission();
            return;
        }
#endif
        InitializeCamera();
    }    private void InitializeCamera()
    {
        WebCamTexture webcamTexture = new WebCamTexture();
        Renderer renderer = GetComponent<Renderer>();
        renderer.material.mainTexture = webcamTexture;
        webcamTexture.Play();
    }
}
```

### Static Properties

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| devices | Return a list of available devices. |

### Properties

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| autoFocusPoint | This property allows you to set/get the auto focus point of the camera. This works only on Android and iOS devices. |
| deviceName | Set this to specify the name of the device to use. |
| didUpdateThisFrame | Did the video buffer update this frame? |
| isDepth | This property is true if the texture is based on depth data. |
| isPlaying | Returns if the camera is currently playing. |
| requestedFPS | Set the requested frame rate of the camera device (in frames per second). |
| requestedHeight | Set the requested height of the camera device. |
| requestedWidth | Set the requested width of the camera device. |
| videoRotationAngle | Returns an clockwise angle (in degrees), which can be used to rotate a polygon so camera contents are shown in correct orientation. |
| videoVerticallyMirrored | Returns if the texture image is vertically flipped. |

### Constructors

| Constructor | Description |
| --- | --- |
| WebCamTexture | Create a WebCamTexture. |

### Public Methods

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| GetPixel | Gets the pixel color at coordinates (x, y). |
| GetPixels | Gets the pixel color data for a mipmap level as Color structs. |
| GetPixels32 | Gets the pixel color data for a mipmap level as Color32 structs. |
| Pause | Pauses the camera. |
| Play | Starts the camera. |
| Stop | Stops the camera. |

### Inherited Members

### Static Properties

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| allowThreadedTextureCreation | Allow Unity internals to perform Texture creation on any thread (rather than the dedicated render thread). |
| currentTextureMemory | The amount of memory that all Textures in the scene use. |
| desiredTextureMemory | The total amount of texture memory, in bytes, that Unity would use if no constraints are applied. |
| GenerateAllMips | Can be used with Texture constructors that take a mip count to indicate that all mips should be generated. The value of this field is -1. |
| nonStreamingTextureCount | The number of non-streaming Textures in the scene. This includes instances of Texture2D and CubeMap Textures. This does not include any other Texture types, or 2D and CubeMap Textures that Unity creates internally. |
| nonStreamingTextureMemory | The amount of memory Unity allocates for non-streaming Textures in the scene. This only includes instances of Texture2D and CubeMap Textures. This does not include any other Texture types, or 2D and CubeMap Textures that Unity creates internally. |

| streamingRendererCount | Number of renderers registered with the Texture streaming system. |
| streamingTextureCount | Number of streaming Textures. |
| streamingTextureDiscardUnusedMips | This property forces the streaming Texture system to discard all unused mipmaps instead of caching them until the Texture memory budget is exceeded. This is useful when you profile or write tests to keep a predictable set of Textures in memory. |
