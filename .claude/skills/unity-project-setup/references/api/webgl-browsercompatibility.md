# Web browser compatibility

This page gives an overview of Unity’s Web platform support for desktop and mobile browsers.

## Web browser compatibility for desktop

Unity’s Web platform support for desktop browsers differs depending on the browser. It supports browsers providing the following conditions are true:

- The browser is **WebGL** 2 capable.
- The browser is HTML 5 standards-compliant.
- The browser is 64-bit and supports WebAssembly.

The Unity Web platform supports some compressed **texture formats**. For information on the compressed texture formats that Unity Web supports, refer to Recommended, default, and supported texture compression formats, by platform. For more detail about texture **compression**, refer to Texture compression in Web.

Web platform supports the following desktop browsers:

| **Desktop Browser** | **Desktop Platforms** |
| --- | --- |
| Google Chrome | Windows, macOS, Linux |
| Mozilla Firefox | Windows, macOS, Linux |
| Apple Safari | macOS |
| Microsoft Edge | Windows, macOS, Linux |

**Notes:**

- The Web platform also supports the latest version of the Chromium-based Edge browser.
- Apple Safari doesn’t support WebGL 2 in versions before Safari 15.
- Apple Safari doesn’t support IndexedDB for content running in an iFrame.
- On Linux, you might have to install Advanced Audio Coding (AAC) codec support via a package manager (for example, the GStreamer package).

## Web browser compatibility for mobile

The Unity Web platform supports some mobile browsers. To use a Web application on a mobile device, you have a few options:

- Run the application in your mobile browser.
- Use WebView to embed the application into native apps.
- Use a **Progressive Web App** (PWA) template.

Unity’s Web platform supports the following mobile browsers:

| **Mobile Browser** | **Mobile Platform** |
| --- | --- |
| iOS Safari 15 and newer | iOS |
| Chrome 58 and newer | Android |

**Note**: Use the latest browser versions for the best experience. Older versions might have issues that affect performance or prevent Unity content from running.
