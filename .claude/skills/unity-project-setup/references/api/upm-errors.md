## Error messages in the Package Manager window

The Package Manager displays error indicators in the Package Manager window when it encounters problems.

### System-wide issues

- **Network connection issues** Error messages appear in the status bar when the Package Manager has detected an issue that isn’t related to a specific package. For example, if the Package Manager can’t access the package registry server, it displays this message in the status bar:   Network error message
- **Error refreshing assets (or Error refreshing packages)** If your network can’t reach the package registry server, it’s probably because there is a connection problem with the network. When you or your system administrator diagnose and fix the network error, the status bar clears. If your network connection is working, but you aren’t signed into your [Unity account](https://id.unity.com/), the Package Manager doesn’t display any Asset Store packages. When you try to use the **My Assets** context, the Package Manager prompts you to sign in:   Logged out of Unity account  Click the **Sign in** button inside the list panel to sign into your Unity account through the Unity Hub.

### Package-specific issues

- If a specific package has a problem when loading or installing (for example, when determining which package versions to load), the error icon () appears in the list panel next to the compromised package **(A)**. To find out what the problem is, check the compromised package’s details panel to view the detailed error message **(B)**:   Dependency error message

## Package Manager missing or window doesn’t open

The Package Manager window might get moved offscreen or hidden by another window. When this happens, it looks like the Package Manager window failed to open. In this case, you can try to reset the window layout (**Window** > **Layouts** > **Default**) and reopen the Package Manager window again.

If the Package Manager window still doesn’t appear, check your Unity **Console window**:

```
Failed to resolve packages: The file [<project-path>/Packages/manifest.json] is not valid JSON:
  Unexpected token '}' at 44:1
  }
```

This error message indicates a malformed `manifest.json` file. It also tells you the line number where the Package Manager failed to parse the file, so you can fix the JSON. There are several online validators that you can use to try to correct the problem. Once you save the corrected file, Unity reloads the Package Manager window.

If you upgraded from an earlier version of the Unity Editor, there might be other problems with your **package manifest** file:

- As of 2019.3, your `manifest.json` file shouldn’t contain any references to the **com.unity.package-manager-ui** package. Remove the following line from the manifest’s dependencies list: `"com.unity.package-manager-ui": "2.1.1",`
- Check if your **project manifest** uses **“exclude”** as a package version. This is an obsolete value for the dependencies property. If you find any lines like these, remove the entire line. Package Manager only installs packages that are explicitly included as a dependency in your project, so once you remove that entry, Package Manager ignores the package and doesn’t install it.

## Problems after upgrading Unity to new version

When you upgrade a project to a newer Unity version, the Package Manager automatically updates incompatible packages to newer compatible versions. However, if your package doesn’t compile, the Package Manager displays error messages in the **Console** window.

To correct these messages, read the error messages and fix any problems you can. For example, a package might be missing a dependency on another package or version. In that case, you can try and install the package yourself.

You can also try the following sequence of solutions until you find something that works:

- Back up and then delete the `Packages` folder under your project.
- Back up and then delete the package sources in your project’s `Packages` folder, leaving only the `manifest.json` file. Then try to reload the project.

## Package installation fails

If you are trying to install a new package from the registry and it’s not working, it might be due to permission problems.

You must have full permissions on the cache folder:

- Windows (user account): `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Unity\cache\upm`
- Windows (system account): `%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\Unity\cache\upm`
- macOS: `$HOME/Library/Caches/Unity/upm`
- Linux: `$HOME/.cache/Unity/upm`

It might be a problem with the network. Check your firewall and proxy settings.

Sometimes institutional environments, such as schools, government offices, or network-protected workplaces set up proxy servers to control traffic between the network and the Internet, and use their own server certificates which aren’t recognized by Unity or the Package Manager. Talk to your network administrator.

## Unable to add package from Git URL

Refer to Repository not found.

## Insufficient drive space

If your installation drive is out of space or low on space, consider the following solutions:

- Change the location of the global cache. Refer to Customize the global cache.
- Change the location of the asset package cache. Refer to Customize the asset package cache location.
- Reduce the maximum size of the registry data cache limit. Refer to Customize the global cache.

## Unity cannot verify this package because it lacks a signature

Starting with Unity 6.3, Package Manager checks every package for a signature. Package signatures make it easier for developers and users to confirm the source and integrity of packages, and to detect any unauthorized changes or tampering during distribution.

If you get this message, try these solutions:

- Use a signed version of the package. If you can’t find one, contact the package owner and ask if they can publish a signed version.
- If you own the package, sign it by referring to Export and sign your UPM package.

## Package version doesn’t have a valid signature

**Important**
 All 6.4 builds before `6000.4.0b6` have a known issue where the Package Manager can report packages as invalid, even though they have a valid package signature.
 This issue is fixed in `6000.4.0b6` and later. Update to one of these builds to address the issue.
 For information about this issue in other versions of the Unity Editor, refer to [Unity Discussions](https://discussions.unity.com/t/package-manager-invalid-signatures-issue/1705385).
 For more information about package signatures, refer to Package signatures.

The package was modified after it was signed, which might indicate tampering.

Packages have a signature to ensure that the content wasn’t changed before or during transit. An invalid signature typically occurs in the following situations:

- Someone published the package with modifications on their own registry.
- An error occurred while transferring the file to the end user.

In both cases, Package Manager considers the package to be potentially malicious.

If you receive an invalid signature on a package from an official channel, such as the Unity registry or Asset Store, do one of the following:

- Install a different version of the package.
- Download the package again from the official channel.

If you are sharing a Unity package that has a fix, consider using a Git URL or embedding the package in your project.

## No ‘git’ executable was found

If you try to install a package from a git URL, a message similar to this appears:

```
Cannot perform upm operation: Unable to add package
[https://github.example.com/myuser/myrepository.git]:
No 'git' executable was found. Please install Git on your system and restart Unity [NotFound]
UnityEditor.EditorApplication:Internal_CallUpdateFunctions()
```

## git-lfs: command not found

If you are trying to download a package that uses Git LFS (Large File Storage), you might get this error message:

```
Error when executing git command. git-lfs filter-process: command not found.
```

This indicates that Git LFS is probably not installed on your computer. To make sure, test it on the command line:

```
git lfs --version
```

Git LFS is installed if the command returns something like this:

```
git-lfs/2.8.0 (GitHub; darwin amd64; go 1.12.7)
```

Otherwise, you can install it by following the [Bitbucket](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/git-lfs) [GitHub](https://git-lfs.github.com/) instructions.

## Git LFS errors

The Package Manager supports installing packages from repositories that use Git Large File Storage (LFS). Unity initially attempts shallow clones for performance, but automatically falls back to full repository clones when Git LFS requires it, such as when fetching unadvertised objects.

If a download operation fetches the placeholder pointer file instead of the actual file contents, the most probable culprit might be the location of the `.gitattributes` file. Unity supports two locations for the `.gitattributes` file, the root of the repository and the root of the package directory. To reduce the risk of issues:

- Make sure your `.gitattributes` file is correctly configured to ensure you’re tracking only the intended files with LFS.
- Avoid placing essential package code or assets under LFS tracking. If you must store large assets with LFS, keep them outside the Unity package (for example, in a separate repository) and import them into Unity using another method (such as AssetBundles or a dedicated asset repository).

## Repository not found

If the Package Manager can’t locate the repository you specified, the Unity Console displays an error message:

```
Cannot perform upm operation: Unable to add package [https://mycompany.github.com/gitproject/com.mycompany.mypackage.git]:
  Error when executing git command. fatal: repository 'https://mycompany.github.com/gitproject/com.mycompany.mypackage.git/' not found
 [NotFound]
UnityEditor.EditorApplication:Internal_CallUpdateFunctions() (at /Users/builduser/buildslave/unity/build/Editor/Mono/EditorApplication.cs:310)
```

Check your spelling. To make sure you are using the correct URL, go to the repository’s page and copy the URL from the Clone button:

Click the button to the right of the URL on GitHub **(A)** or GitLab **(B)** to copy the URL to your clipboard.

If the location of the repository is correct, there might be another problem with the URL:

- If you are targeting a specific revision, make sure your revision comes last. For example: 
 `https://github.example.com/myuser/myrepository1.git#revision`
- If you are targeting a revision and the package isn’t at the root, make sure the `path` query parameter precedes the revision anchor. For example:
`https://github.example.com/myuser/myrepository.git?path=/example/folder#v1.2.3`

If the location of the repository and URL are correct, check your `PATH` system environment variable. Make sure the `PATH` variable includes entries for the Git `cmd` directory (Windows) and the Git `bin` directory (Windows, macOS). Package Manager processes require these entries in the `PATH` variable.

## Could not read Username: terminal prompts disabled

If you are trying to install a package from a private repository that requires authentication, a message similar to this one appears in the Unity Console:

```
Cannot perform upm operation: Unable to add package [https://mycompany.github.com/gitproject/com.mycompany.mypackage.git]:
  Error when executing git command. fatal: could not read Username for 'https://mycompany.github.com': terminal prompts disabled
 [NotFound]
UnityEditor.EditorApplication:Internal_CallUpdateFunctions() (at /Users/builduser/buildslave/unity/build/Editor/Mono/EditorApplication.cs:310)
```

Usually, this message appears because Package Manager doesn’t provide an interactive terminal or dialog where you can enter your username and password for HTTP, or your passphrase to unlock your SSH key:

- With **HTTP(S)**, every time you log onto Bitbucket, GitHub, or GitLab you need to enter your username and password in a terminal or a dialog. However, the Package Manager doesn’t provide an interactive terminal or dialog where you can enter your username and password for HTTP(S). To bypass this, use one of the workarounds suggested in Solutions for HTTPS.
- **SSH** uses a pair of public and private SSH keys. You can add your public SSH key to [Bitbucket](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/set-up-an-ssh-key/), [GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh), or [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/help/ssh/README.md) and then access repositories without having to enter a username and password. However, if you have set up a passphrase to keep your SSH key safe, you still have to enter that passphrase in a terminal or a dialog to authorize your key. In that case, you can use an SSH agent that can unlock your SSH key to authenticate with the Package Manager on your behalf.

### Solutions for HTTPS

The Package Manager doesn’t provide an interactive terminal or dialog where you can enter your HTTP(S) username and password. To bypass this, use one of these workarounds:

- Follow the instructions at Using private repositories with HTTPS Git URLs and Using passphrase-protected SSH keys with SSH Git URLs.
- Use a credential manager ([Git Credential Manager for Windows](https://github.com/Microsoft/Git-Credential-Manager-for-Windows) or [OSXKeyChain](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/keychain-access/welcome/mac)). Credential managers handle sending the password without having to use a terminal or a command prompt.
- Use [git-credentials](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Credential-Storage) from a terminal or command prompt, then launch the Hub from the same terminal so that Unity has access to the cached or stored credentials.
- Use SSH to authenticate instead. If you set up your SSH key without a passphrase, the Package Manager doesn’t have to decrypt it to authenticate with the Git server. If you decide to use a passphrase for added security, you can use the **ssh-agent** on either macOS or Windows to get around the authentication problem.

### Solutions for SSH

If you use the SSH protocol to install a package by Git URL, you might get an authentication error from Git. This typically happens when you set up a private SSH key on your local computer that you protected with a passphrase.

The solution to this problem is to set up an SSH agent that can unlock your SSH key to authenticate with the Package Manager on your behalf. Follow the instructions in the section that corresponds to your operating system:

- Setting up OpenSSH for Windows
- Adding SSH keys to your SSH Agent for macOS

#### Setting up OpenSSH for Windows

The built-in Windows OpenSSH version of the **ssh-agent** works better than the version available by default with Git for Windows. This procedure explains how to set up the OpenSSH client and add your key to its ssh-agent. If you are using Git for Windows, you can also prioritize the built-in Windows OpenSSH over the Git for Windows SSH agent:

1. Make sure the OpenSSH Client is installed. To do this, search for it in the Windows Settings **Optional features** window (**Start** > **Settings**, then search for “Optional features”). This applies to Windows 10+.
2. Check your `%PATH%` environment variable to make sure the built-in Windows OpenSSH location appears (for example, `C:\WINDOWS\System32\OpenSSH\`).  **Note**: If you’re already using Git for Windows, make sure the built-in Windows OpenSSH location appears before the Git for Windows SSH location in your `%PATH%` variable. This ensures that Windows uses the built-in Windows OpenSSH agent over the Git for Windows SSH agent.
3. In a PowerShell terminal, start the `ssh-agent` process and make sure it starts automatically: `# Set the ssh-agent service to start automatically and manually start it now Get-Service ssh-agent | Set-Service -StartupType Automatic # Run the ssh-agent process to start the ssh-agent service ssh-agent`
4. Import your key into the ssh-agent. To do this, run `ssh-add` on the command line and then follow the instructions. By default, the agent adds the `%USERPROFILE%\.ssh\id_rsa` key and prompts you for the password. `# Import the key ssh-add` To use a different key, you can specify it as an argument: `# Set the ssh-agent service to start automatically and manually start it now ssh-add <your-secure-ssh-key-name>` If you can’t remember the name of your key, use the following command to list your keys: `ssh-add -l`
5. If you installed Git for Windows, reset the `%GIT-SSH%` environment variable to make sure that Git always uses the built-in Windows OpenSSH version of the ssh-agent: `[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("GIT_SSH", "$((Get-Command ssh).Source)", [System.EnvironmentVariableTarget]::User)`

#### Adding SSH keys to your SSH Agent for macOS

Use the `ssh-add` command to add your SSH keys to the [ssh-agent](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/agent) running on your macOS system. The command parameter you use depends on your version of macOS:

- On macOS 11 and earlier, use: `ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/<your-secure-ssh-key-name>`
- On macOS 12 and later, use: `ssh-add --apple-use-keychain ~/.ssh/<your-secure-ssh-key-name>`

After you run this command, the terminal asks for the password to unlock your SSH key and then adds it to the macOS keychain. However, once you restart your system, every key stored in the ssh-agent is reset.

To make sure you don’t need to re-enter your password after you restart your system, open the `~/.ssh/config` file (or create one if you don’t find it), and add the following:

```
Host *
    UseKeychain yes
    AddKeysToAgent yes
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/<your-secure-ssh-key-name>
```

Restart your computer to apply these changes.

## Can’t update Git version

If you’re trying to update your **Git dependency** to a newer version from the repository, but it’s not working, it’s probably because of a locked Git dependency. If you want to update your Git dependency to a newer version from the repository, use the Add package from Git URL button and enter a Git URL. For more information, refer to Locked Git dependencies.

## ‘Failed to parse http response’ in My Assets context

If you get the following message in the **Console** window when you try to download an asset package from the Asset Store, there might be a problem with your asset package cache:

`[PackageManager] Error Failed to parse response. UnityEditor.AsyncHTTPClient![:D](https://forum.unity.com/styles/default/xenforo/clear.png)one(State, Int32)`

To solve this problem, delete all downloaded assets from the Location of downloaded asset package files and then try to download the assets again.

**Warning**: If your project has a lot of asset data, it might take a lot of time and bandwidth to re-download everything.

## Missing ‘My Registries’ in the Package Manager window

Not all registry providers are compatible with Unity’s Package Manager. If the package registry server you added doesn’t implement the `/-/v1/search` or `/-/all` endpoints, your scoped registry isn’t compatible with Unity’s Package Manager, and doesn’t appear under **My Registries** in the navigation panel of the Package Manager window.

## Missing MonoBehaviour errors

While building, if there are a lot of errors about Missing Behavior, the UnityLinker might be mistakenly stripping out a component that it thinks is unreferenced. It often does this because the stripping level is too aggressive. For example, if you have a **prefab** in an AssetBundle that references the SpriteShape component in the 2D SpriteShape package, the object might be missing and might generate compiler warnings.

To fix this, you can either lower the stripping level for the UnityLinker or declare the package’s assemblies inside the `link.xml` file to preserve them from being stripped:

```
<linker>
    <assembly fullname="Unity.2D.SpriteShape.Runtime" preserve="all"/>
    <assembly fullname="Unity.2D.Common.Runtime" preserve="all"/>
 </linker>
```

For more information on stripping levels and the UnityLinker, refer to Managed code stripping.
