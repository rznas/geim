# Set up your 3D panoramic video

Use 3D panoramic videos to create immersive environments in **virtual reality** (VR) or 3D **scenes**.

This information covers how to use your panoramic video for 3D scenes or for use in **VR**. VR support is especially useful if your source video has stereo content.

## Prerequisites

Before you try to set up a 3D panoramic video, you need to:

1. Set up a panoramic video.
2. If your video has a 360° view, set up a panoramic video as a skybox.

## Set up your 360° 3D panoramic video

360° 3D panoramic videos provide a fully immersive view of the scene.

To enable your panoramic video for 3D:

1. Click on your **skybox** material (panoramic or cubemap).
2. Set **3D Layout** to the layout of your panoramic video. For more information on the options, refer to 3D panoramic videos.

## Set up your non–360° 3D panoramic video

For non–360° 3D panoramic videos, a skybox material isn’t recommended. Follow these steps instead:

1. Click on your panoramic video’s Video Player **GameObject**.
2. In the **Inspector** window, set **Render Mode** to either ****Camera** Near Plane** or **Camera Far Plane**.
3. Set **3D Layout** to the layout of your panoramic video. For more information on the options, refer to 3D panoramic videos.
