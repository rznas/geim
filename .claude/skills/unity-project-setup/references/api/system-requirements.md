## Unity Editor system requirements

This section lists the hardware and software requirements to run the Unity Editor. Actual performance and rendering quality might vary depending on the complexity of your project.

For all operating systems, the Unity Editor is supported on workstations or laptop form factors running without emulation, container or compatibility layer.

| **Operating system** | **Operating system version** | **CPU** | **Graphics API** | **Additional requirements** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Windows** | Windows 10 version 21H1 (build 19043) or newer (X64), Windows 11 21H2 (build 22000) or newer (Arm64) | X64 architecture with SSE2 instruction set support, Arm64 | DX10, DX11, DX12 or Vulkan capable GPUs | Hardware vendor officially supported drivers |
| **macOS** | Ventura 13 or newer | X64 architecture with SSE2 instruction set support (Intel processors)  Apple M1 or above (Apple silicon-based processors) | Metal-capable Intel and AMD GPUs | Apple officially supported drivers (Intel processor)   Rosetta 2 is required for Apple silicon devices running on either Apple silicon or Intel versions of the Unity Editor |
| **Linux** | Ubuntu 22.04, Ubuntu 24.04 | X64 architecture with SSE2 instruction set support | OpenGL 3.2+ or Vulkan-capable, Nvidia and AMD GPUs | Gnome desktop environment running on top of X11 or Wayland windowing system, Nvidia official proprietary graphics driver, or AMD Mesa graphics driver. Other configurations and user environments as provided with the supported distribution (Kernel, Compositor, etc.)   **Notes:**  • **Ubuntu 22.04:** Wayland is supported with AMD graphics cards.   • **Ubuntu 24.04:** Wayland is supported with AMD graphics cards and Nvidia graphics cards utilizing Nvidia proprietary graphics drivers 550 and above. |

### RAM recommendations for the Unity Editor

To run the Unity Editor on Windows, macOS, or Linux, a minimum of 8 GB RAM is recommended.

However, the amount of RAM required to load and run your project depends on your project’s size and complexity. Larger and more complex projects require additional RAM.

### Hard disk recommendations for the Unity Editor

When creating a build, the Editor reads and writes many small files to disk. To improve performance when creating a build, it’s recommended to use a disk drive with a high Input/Output Operations Per Second (IOPS) rating.

For more information on creating a build, refer to Introduction to building.

## Unity Editor platform limitations

### Windows on Arm

- Download and install of Windows on Arm Editor via the Unity Hub is only possible through Hub version v3.7.0 Beta 1 or later. For more information, see the [Unity Hub release notes](https://unity.com/unity-hub/release-notes).  To switch to the latest beta version of the Hub, change **Preferences** > **Advanced** > **Channel** to **Beta**. Alternatively, re-download Unity: [https://unity.com/download](https://unity.com/download).
- Unity doesn’t support platforms that don’t provide native Windows Arm64 SDKs. Build for these platforms might still work with x86 emulation for Windows on Arm.
- Unity doesn’t support packages with third-party binary dependencies that don’t provide native Windows on Arm support. These packages might work with x86 emulation for Windows on Arm.
- Unity doesn’t support Vulkan for Windows on Arm.

### Apple

On macOS, secondary Editor windows only maximize, and don’t enter full screen mode.

### Linux

The Linux Editor has the following limitations:

- Video importing is limited to the VP8 video format.
- File systems are case sensitive.
- If the Editor generates a `Pipe error !` message, you must increase the maximum open file limit in your current Editor session. For example, run `ulimit -n 4096` in the terminal before launching the Editor. For more information, refer to the Troubleshooting Linux Editor issues page.
- Wayland support for Desktop Linux is currently in experimental stage. To run the Linux player in Native Wayland mode when using a Wayland session, use `-force-wayland` command line argument.

## Unity Player system requirements

This section lists the minimum requirements to build and run the Unity Player. Actual performance and rendering quality might vary depending on the complexity of your project.
