# Requirements and compatibility

Although the Apple TV platform (tvOS) is similar to the iOS platform, there are some differences between the two. Before developing your application for tvOS, review the requirements, compatibility notes, and known limitations.

## Xcode version support

When developing for iOS, it’s recommended to use Xcode version 16 or later. For more information, refer to [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/support/xcode/).

## Compatibility

It’s best practice to create a separate branch or copy of your application and port that to Apple TV. tvOS only supports a subset of the iOS framework. This means that **plug-ins** that are compatible with iOS might not be compatible with tvOS.

If your app uses more than 4 GB on disk, break it into smaller parts and use On Demand Resources.

**Note:** Bitcode is included with tvOS builds, which adds around 130 MB to your executables. App Store servers strip this code, so it doesn’t affect your distribution size. To estimate Bitcode size, analyze the [LLVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LLVM) sections in your executable from the command line with `otool -1`.

## Implementing support for On Demand Resources

tvOS limits how much disk space your application can reserve. The main application installation bundle size can’t be larger than 4 GB. The limits for additional downloadable content are up to 2 GB for in-use assets, and up to 20 GB of total downloadable content. Apple recommends the use of On Demand Resources (ODR) for tvOS downloadable content, which is the best disk space management for tvOS. Unity supports ****ODR**** via **Asset Bundles**.

## Known limitations

- The on-screen keyboard is limited to single line entries.
- [tvOS Simulator](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/running-your-app-in-the-simulator-or-on-a-device/) doesn’t emulate the Apple TV Remote as an app controller, which means apps can’t access its input.
