# Additional Search filters

This page reviews additional search filters that you can use to narrow down your search results.

## Combine search tokens for complex searches

You can combine search tokens to create more complex queries.

- The queries are written on one line with one character space between tokens.
- The character space between each new token is an “And” operation, so both filters must be true for the query to return a result. Add another operator (or, <, >) to return different results.
- If a Search Provider filter token (h:, p:) is used, it must be the first component in the query.

Here are a few examples:

| Query | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `h: t:meshrenderer p(castshadows)!="Off"` | Searches all static meshes in a **Scene** that cast a shadow. |
| `h: t:light p(color)=#FFFFFF p(intensity)>7.4` | Searches all lights in a Scene with a specific color with brightness higher than 7.4. |
| `h: path:/Collectables t:collectable` | Find all objects with a component `Collectable` located in the path `/Collectables.` |

## Cross-reference across multiple providers with search expressions

Search expressions allow you to add to the search query language to express complex queries that cross-reference multiple providers, for example, to search for all objects in a scene that use a **shader** that doesn’t compile. Refer to Search expressions for more information.

## Type Filters

These filters are available if the index uses the Types Indexing option (See Index Manager).

| Filter | Search token | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Type** | `t:<Asset Type>` | `t:texture`  Searches all Assets containing texture in their type name (ex: Texture2D, Texture).  `t:prefab`  Searches all prefab assets. |
| **Type** | `<Asset Type>` | You can search Assets by type without using the t: filter above.  `texture`  Searches all Assets containing texture in their type name (ex: Texture2D, Texture) or in their name (ex: myTexture.png).  `prefab`  Searches all Prefab Assets or Assets with “prefab” in their name. |
| **File** | `t:file` | `t:file level1`  Searches all file Assets containing the word level1. |
| **Folder** | `t:folder` | `t:folder`  Searches all folder Assets. |

## Indexed Property Search

Searching properties is available if the index has been specified with the Properties Indexing option (see Index Manager). To view the list of all indexed properties check the Index Manager Keywords tab. All property values are converted to a string or number. The name of the property has to be complete and not partial (case does not matter though). Unity indexes properties at the top level object of a **Prefab** Asset. If you want all Prefab hierarchies to be indexed, create a Prefab Index (see Index Manager). For .unity files Unity indexes the properties of the SceneAsset and not the Scene content. If you want all Scene contents to be indexed, create a Scene Index (see Index Manager).

| Filter | Search token | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Type** | `t:<type>` | When using the indexed Property, you can use `t:` to search for a component type for an Asset type.  `t:collider`  Searches all Prefabs containing a component with the word `collider`.  `t:texture`  Searches all Assets with a type containing the word `texture` (ex: Texture or Texture2D). |
| **Has Component** | `t:<component type>` | `t:collider`  Searches all Prefabs containing a component with the word collider.  `t=BoxCollider`  Searches all Prefabs containing a component called BoxCollider. |
| **Label** | `l:<label name>` | `l:archi`  Searches all Assets with a label containing the word `archi` (e.g.: Architecture).  `l=Wall`  Searches all Assets with a label that is exactly `Wall`. |

All properties of an Asset (Prefab or other types) are indexed and searchable. Here are a few examples of Property query:

| Filter | Search token | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Number** | `property:value` | `bounciness>0.1`  Searches all assets with a property named `bounciness` (e.g.: a PhysicsMaterial2D) higher than 0.1.  `health=2`  Searches all Assets with a property named `health` (e.g.: HealthSystem Component of a Prefab) with of a value of exactly 2.  `t:texture filtermode!=0`  Searches all textures with a `filtermode` property different than 0 (i.e different than Point). |
| **Boolean** | `property:value` | `t:Dungeon generatePath=true`  Searches all Dungeon ScriptableObjects where the property `generatePath` is true.  `isStunned=false`  Searches all GameObjects containing a property `isStunned` that is false. |
| **String** | `property:string value` | `t:Character trait:indestru`  Searches all Prefab with a Character component whose trait property contains the word `indestru` (ex: indestructible).  `t:Character trait="tough but fair"`  Searches all Prefab with a Character component whose trait property is exactly `tough but fair`. |
| **Enum** | `property:<enum value>` | `characterclass:rog`  Searches all GameObjects with with a property named `characterclass` whose value contains the word rog (e.g.: value is rogue).  `characterclass=FighterMage`  Searches all GameObjects with a property named `characterclass` with an exact value of `FighterMage`. |
| **Color** | `property:<html color value>` | `color:ADA`  Searches all GameObjects with a property named `color` where the color value starts with ADA (like ADADAD00).  `color=ADADAD00`  Searches all GameObjects with a property named `color` where the color value is exactly ADADAD00.  `color=ADADAD`<br/> Searches all GameObjects with a property named color where the color value is exactly ADADAD and alpha value is 1. |
| **Vector** | `property.[xyzw]:value` | `bounds.x>1`  Searches all GameObjects with a property named `bounds` where the x value is larger than 1.  `acceleration.z=2`  Searches all GameObjects with a property named acceleration where the z value is equal to 2 |
| **Object** | `sprite:<object exact name>` | `sprite:CharacterBody`  Searches all Assets with a `sprite` property (e.g.: Image Component of a Prefab) that references a GameObject named CharacterBody. |

## Dependency filters

If you are using the Dependencies Indexing option (See Index Manager) Unity indexes **direct dependencies** of all Assets using AssetDatabase.GetDependencies.

| Filter | Search  token | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Reference Path** | `ref:<asset full path>` | `ref:assets/images/particles/p_smoke.png` Searches all Assets that have direct dependencies on the **exact** Asset path: `assets/images/particles/p_smoke.png` . |
| **Reference Name** | `ref:<asset name>` | `ref:p_smo` Searches all Assets that have direct dependencies on an Asset whose name contains the word `p_smo`.   `ref:p_smoke.png` Searches all Assets that have direct dependencies on an Asset named `p_smoke.png`. |

## Search for null values

Search any object property for a `null` value using the `none` keyword:

```
h:#MeshFilter.m_mesh=none
```
