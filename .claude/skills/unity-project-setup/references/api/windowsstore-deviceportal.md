# Deploy a Windows or UWP app with the Windows Device Portal

You can use the [Windows Device Portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/debug-test-perf/device-portal) to build and run Windows or Universal Windows Platform (UWP) applications to a remote Windows 10+ device directly from the Unity Editor, alleviating the need to generate a Visual Studio project. Being connected remotely to a remote Windows device allows you to make faster iterations for testing your Unity Project.

## Set up the Device Portal

Before you set up the Device Portal in Unity, make sure that you [enable Developer Mode and Device Portal on your Windows device](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/debug-test-perf/device-portal) using the **For Developer** section in Settings (Settings > Privacy & security > For developers).

To access the Device Portal settings for your Unity project:

1. Go to **File** > **Build Profiles**.
2. From the list of platforms in the **Platforms** panel, select **Windows** or create a build profile for the **Windows** platform. To build **UWP**, select **Universal Windows Platform** in the **Platforms** panel.
3. Set **Build and Run on** as **Remote Device (via Device Portal)**.
4. Fill in the following fields that appear.

| **Setting** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Device Portal Address** | Enter the IP address and port number for the Device Portal. On Windows, locate the address in **Privacy & security** > **For Developers** > **Device Portal** > **Connect using**. |
| **Device Portal Username** | Enter the username for the Device Portal. This is optional if you [enable WDP authentication](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/debug-test-perf/device-portal). |
| **Device Portal Password** | Enter the password for the Device Portal. This is optional if you [enable WDP authentication](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/debug-test-perf/device-portal). |

Unity saves the **Device Portal Address** and **Device Portal Username** fields in ****Project settings****. For security purposes, Unity doesn’t save your Device Portal password, so you might need to re-enter your password when you restart the Editor or load a new project.

**Tip:** You can also use the Executable Only build type with Device Portal deployment for **UWP**. This makes iteration times faster on devices like HoloLens.

## Run your app on the remote device

When you have completed the setup for the Device Portal, select **Build and Run**. This builds the UWP/Windows app, deploys it to the remote device, and then launches it.
