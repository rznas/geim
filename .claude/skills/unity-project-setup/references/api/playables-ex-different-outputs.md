# Create a PlayableGraph with different outputs

This example demonstrates how to create a `PlayableGraph` with two different playable output types: an `AudioPlayableOutput` and an `AnimationPlayableOutput`. This example also demonstrates how to play an `AudioClip` through an `AudioClipPlayable` connected to an `AudioPlayableOutput`.

## Prerequisites

Before you use the `DifferentOutputs` script in your project, your project must have the following:

- A **GameObject**, such as a cube or a capsule. You don’t need to manually add an **Animator component** or an **Audio Source** component to this GameObject. The `RequireComponent` attribute adds these components if they’re not present.
- An animation clip that animates the properties of the GameObject. For example, an animation that changes the position and rotation of a GameObject. If your project doesn’t have an animation clip, you won’t be able to select a clip and nothing will happen at runtime.
- An **audio clip**. If your project doesn’t have an audio clip, you will not be able to play audio while the GameObject animates.

## Add and run the script

To use the `DifferentOutputs` script in your project, follow these steps:

1. Add a script component to your GameObject. Name the script file `DifferentOutputs.cs` and use the following code: `using UnityEngine; using UnityEngine.Animations; using UnityEngine.Audio; using UnityEngine.Playables; [RequireComponent(typeof(Animator))] [RequireComponent(typeof(AudioSource))] public class DifferentOutputs : MonoBehaviour { public AnimationClip animationClip; public AudioClip audioClip; PlayableGraph graph; void Start() { // Create and name the graph. graph = PlayableGraph.Create("DifferentOutputs"); // Create the outputs. var animationOutput = AnimationPlayableOutput.Create(graph, "Animation", GetComponent<Animator>()); var audioOutput = AudioPlayableOutput.Create(graph, "Audio", GetComponent<AudioSource>()); // Create the playables. var animationClipPlayable = AnimationClipPlayable.Create(graph, animationClip); var audioClipPlayable = AudioClipPlayable.Create(graph, audioClip, true); // Connect the playables to an output. animationOutput.SetSourcePlayable(animationClipPlayable); audioOutput.SetSourcePlayable(audioClipPlayable); // Play the Graph. graph.Play(); } void OnDisable() { // Destroys all Playables and Outputs created by the graph. graph.Destroy(); } }`
2. In the Script component, select the Animation Clip and Audio Clip that the PlayableGraph will play at runtime.
3. Select **Play** to switch the Editor to Play mode.
4. If you have installed the PlayableGraph Visualizer package, select `MultiOutputSample` to display the PlayableGraph.
