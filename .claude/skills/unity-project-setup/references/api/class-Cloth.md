# Cloth

The Cloth component works with the Skinned **Mesh** Renderer to provide a physics-based solution for simulating fabrics. It is specifically designed for character clothing, and only works with the Skinned **Mesh Renderer**. If you add a Cloth component to a **GameObject** with a regular Mesh Renderer, Unity removes the Mesh Renderer and adds a Skinned Mesh Renderer.

To attach a Cloth component to GameObject that has a Skinned Mesh Renderer, select the GameObject in the Editor, click the **Add Component** button in the Inspector window, and select **Physics** > **Cloth**. The component appears in the Inspector.

## Properties

| **Property** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Stretching Stiffness** | Stretching stiffness of the cloth. |
| **Bending Stiffness** | Bending stiffness of the cloth. |
| **Use Tethers** | Apply constraints that help to prevent the moving cloth **particles** from going too far away from the fixed ones. This helps to reduce excess stretchiness. |
| **Use Gravity** | Should gravitational acceleration be applied to the cloth? |
| **Damping** | Motion damping coefficient. |
| **External Acceleration** | A constant, external acceleration applied to the cloth. |
| **Random Acceleration** | A random, external acceleration applied to the cloth. |
| **World Velocity Scale** | How much world-space movement of the character will affect cloth vertices. |
| **World Acceleration Scale** | How much world-space acceleration of the character will affect cloth vertices. |
| **Friction** | The friction of the cloth when colliding with the character. |
| **Collision Mass Scale** | How much to increase mass of colliding particles. |
| **Use Continuous Collision** | Enable continuous **collision** to improve collision stability. |
| **Use Virtual Particles** | Add one virtual particle per triangle to improve collision stability. |
| **Solver Frequency** | Number of solver iterations per second. |
| **Sleep Threshold** | Cloth’s sleep threshold. |
| **Capsule Colliders** | An array of CapsuleColliders which this Cloth instance should collide with. |
| **Sphere Colliders** | An array of ClothSphereColliderPairs which this Cloth instance should collide with. |
| **Virtual Particle Weights** | Barycentric coordinates of the virtual particles with respect to the three neighbouring normal cloth particles. (These weights are normally not required to be tweaked). |

## Details

Cloth does not react to all **colliders** in a **scene**, nor does it apply forces back to the world. When it has been added the Cloth component will not react to or influence any other bodies at all. Thus Cloth and the world do not recognise or see each other until you manually add colliders from the world to the Cloth component. Even after that, the simulation is still one-way: cloth reacts to those bodies but doesn’t apply forces back.

Additionally, you can only use three types of colliders with cloth: a sphere, a capsule, and conical capsule colliders, constructed using two sphere colliders. These restrictions all exist to help boost performance.

## Edit Constraints Tool

You can apply constraints to specific vertices of the cloth to give them more or less freedom of movement.

In the **Inspector**, select **Edit cloth constraints** (top-left button) in the Cloth component. When the tool is active, small spheres appear in the **Scene view** on all vertices of the mesh. They represent the cloth particles to which you can apply constraints. The color of a particle represents the relative value of its constraint within the cloth, according to the type of constraint currently selected.

The Cloth Constraints tool window also appears at the bottom right of the Scene view.

The Cloth Constraints tool has the following options:

| **Property** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Visualization** | Allows you to select which constraint type and which particles to display. Choose from the following options:   **Max Distance**: Displays only the Max Distance values of the cloth particles.  **Surface Penetration**: Displays only the Surface Penetration values of the cloth particles.  **Manipulate Backfaces**: Enable this option to visualize and manipulate particles that might be hidden behind the current facing part of the cloth.   The Color spectrum provides the correspondence between particle colors and constraint values for the selected constraint type, according to the minimum and maximum values currently applied within the whole cloth. Black always means that the particle has no constraint. |
| **Constraint mode** | Select how to edit the cloth constraint values from the following options:   **Select**: Apply a fixed constraint value to a pre-selected group of particles. For more information, refer to Select mode.  **Paint**: Apply a fixed constraint value by painting the cloth particles with a brush. For more information, refer to Paint mode.  **Gradient**: Apply a left-to-right linear gradient of constraint values to a pre-selected group of particles. For more information, refer to Gradient mode. |
| **Constraint Size** | The display size of the spheres that represent the cloth particles. Adjust this value at your convenience to ease your constraints edition. This property has no effect on the constraints themselves. |

### Select mode

To use the Cloth Constraints tool in Select mode:

1. Select **Select** in the Cloth Constraints window.
2. Use the mouse cursor to draw a selection box or click on particles one at a time.
3. Enable the constraint type that you want to apply to your selection: **Max Distance**, **Surface Penetration**, or both.
4. Set a value according to the constraint type you just enabled.

### Paint mode

To use the Cloth Constraints tool in Paint mode:

1. Select **Paint** in the Cloth Constraints window.
2. Adjust the **Brush Radius** according to the area you need to cover with the brush.
3. Enable the constraint type you want to apply: **Max Distance**, **Surface Penetration**, or both.
4. Set a paint value according to the constraint type you just enabled.
5. Paint the constraints on the particles with the brush.

### Gradient mode

To use the Cloth Constraints tool in Gradient mode:

1. Select **Gradient** in the Cloth Constraints window.
2. Enable the **2D** view in the Scene view (the tool cannot apply a gradient when in 3D view).
3. Use the mouse cursor to draw a selection box or click on particles one at a time.
4. Set the limit values of the gradient you want to apply left-to-right within your selection: **Gradient Start** and **Gradient End**.
5. Enable the constraint type that you want to apply to your selection: **Max Distance**, **Surface Penetration**, or both.

## Self collision and intercollision

Cloth collision makes character clothing and other fabrics in your game move more realistically. In Unity, a cloth has several cloth particles that handle collision. You can set up cloth particles for:

- Self-collision, which prevents cloth from penetrating itself.
- Intercollision, which allows cloth particles to collide with each other.

To set up the collision particles for a cloth, select the **Self Collision and Intercollision** button in the Cloth inspector:

The **Cloth**Self Collision__ And Intercollision__ window appears in the Scene view:

Cloth particles appear automatically for skinned Meshes with a Cloth component. Initially, none of the cloth particles are set to use collision. These unused particles appear black:

To apply self-collision or intercollision, you need to select a single set of particles to apply collision to. To select a set of particles for collision, click the **Select** button:

Now left-click and drag to select the particles you want to apply collision to:

The selected particles appear in blue:

Tick the **Self Collision and Intercollision** checkbox to apply collision to the selected particles:

The particles you specify for use in collision appear in green:

To enable the self collision behavior for a cloth, to go the **Self-Collision** section of the Cloth Inspector window and set **Inter-Collision Distance** and **Inter-Collision Stiffness** to non-zero values:

| **Property** | **Function** |
| --- | --- |
| **Inter-Collision Distance** | The diameter of a sphere around each particle. Unity ensures that these spheres do not overlap during simulations. **Inter-Collision Distance** should be smaller than the smallest distance between two particles in the configuration. If the distance is larger, self collision may violate some distance constraints and result in jittering. |
| **Inter-Collision Stiffness** | How strong the separating impulse between particles should be. The cloth solver calculates this and it should be enough to keep the particles separated. |

Self collision and intercollision can take a significant amount of the overall simulation time. Consider keeping the collision distance small and using self collision indices to reduce the number of particles that collide with each other.

Self collision uses vertices, not triangles, so don’t expect self collision to work perfectly for Meshes with triangles much larger than the cloth thickness.

**Paint** and **Erase** modes allow you to add or remove particles for use in collision by holding the left mouse button down and dragging individual cloth particles:

When in **Paint** or **Erase** mode, particles specified for collision are green, unspecified particles are black, and particles underneath the brush are blue:

### Cloth intercollision

You specify particles for intercollision in the same way as you specify particles for self collision, as described above. As with self collision, you specify one set of particles for intercollision.

To enable intercollision behavior, open the **Physics** settings (from the main menu in Unity: **Edit** > **Project Settings**, then select the **Physics** > **Physics Settings** > **Cloth** category) and set **Inter-Collision Distance** and **Inter-Collision Stiffness** to non-zero values in the **Cloth InterCollision** section:

Cloth intercollision **Inter-Collision Distance** and **Inter-Collision Stiffness** properties have the same function as self collision Distance and Stiffness properties, which are described above.

## Collider collision

Cloth is unable to simply collide with arbitrary world geometry, and now will only interact with the colliders specified in either the Capsule Colliders or Sphere Colliders arrays.

The sphere colliders array can contain either a single valid SphereCollider instance (with the second one being null), or a pair. In the former cases the ClothSphereColliderPair just represents a single sphere collider for the cloth to collide against. In the latter case, it represents a conic capsule shape defined by the two spheres, and the cone connecting the two. Conic capsule shapes are useful for modelling limbs of a character.
