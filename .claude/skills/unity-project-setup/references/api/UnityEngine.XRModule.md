### Description

The XR module contains the VR and AR related platform support functionality.

### Classes

| Class | Description |
| --- | --- |
| CommonUsages | Defines static variables that are used to retrieve input features from XR.InputDevice.TryGetFeatureValue. |
| InputDevices | An interface for accessing devices in the XR input subsytem. |
| InputTracking | A collection of methods and properties for accessing XR input devices by their XR Node representation. |
| XRDisplaySubsystem | An XRDisplaySubsystem controls rendering to a head tracked display. |
| XRDisplaySubsystemDescriptor | Class providing information about XRDisplaySubsystem registration. |
| XRInputSubsystem | XRInputSubsystem Instance is used to enable and disable the inputs coming from a specific plugin. |
| XRInputSubsystemDescriptor | Information about an Input subsystem. |
| XRMeshSubsystem | Allows external systems to provide dynamic meshes to Unity. |
| XRMeshSubsystemDescriptor | Information about an XRMeshSubsystem. |
| XRStats | Provides timing and other statistics from XR subsystems. |

### Structs

| Struct | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Bone | A tracked bone on the device at an XRNode in the XR input subsystem. |
| Eyes | Contains eye tracking data from the device at an XRNode in the XR input subsystem. |
| Hand | A tracked hand on the device at an XRNode in the XR input subsystem. |
| HapticCapabilities | Describes the haptic capabilities of the device at an XRNode in the XR input subsystem. |
| InputDevice | Defines an input device in the XR input subsystem. |
| InputFeatureUsage | Defines a generic usage that maps to an input feature on a device. Use the As method to turn into a generic usage. |
| InputFeatureUsage<T0> | Defines a generic usage that maps to an input feature on a device. |
| MeshGenerationResult | Contains event information related to a generated mesh. |
| MeshId | A session-unique identifier for trackables in the environment, e.g., planes and feature points. |
| MeshInfo | Contains state information related to a tracked mesh. |
| MeshTransform | Contains transform information related to a tracked mesh. |
| XRMirrorViewBlitMode | Engine reserved blit modes. Blit mode capabilities should be queried from XRDisplaySubsystemDescriptor.GetAvailableMirrorBlitModeCount and XRDisplaySubsystemDescriptor.GetMirrorBlitModeByIndex. |
| XRMirrorViewBlitModeDesc | Struct that describes the mirror view blit mode. |
| XRNodeState | Describes the state of a node tracked by an XR system. |

### Enumerations

| Enumeration | Description |
| --- | --- |
| HandFinger | Enumeration describing the AR rendering mode used with Hand. |
| InputDeviceCharacteristics | A set of bit flags describing InputDevice characteristics. |
| InputDeviceRole | Enumeration describing the role of a InputDevice in providing input. |
| InputTrackingState | Represents the values being tracked for this device. |
| MeshChangeState | The state of a tracked mesh since the last query. |
| MeshGenerationOptions | Options for generating meshes. |
| MeshGenerationStatus | The status of a XRMeshSubsystem.GenerateMeshAsync. |
| MeshVertexAttributes | A set of vertex attributes. |
| TrackingOriginModeFlags | This enum provides context to where the 0,0,0 point of tracking for InputDevices is. |
| XRNode | Enumeration of XR nodes which can be updated by XR input or sent haptic data. |
