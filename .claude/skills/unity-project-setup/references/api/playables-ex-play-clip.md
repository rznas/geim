# Play an animation clip

This example demonstrates a `PlayableGraph` with one playable output linked to one playable node. The playable node plays a single animation clip (`clip`). Before a playable node can use an animation clip, you must wrap the clip in an `AnimationClipPlayable`.

## Prerequisites

To use the `PlayAnimationClip` script in your project, your project must have the following:

- A **GameObject**, such as a cube or a capsule. You don’t need to manually add an **Animator component** to this GameObject. The `RequireComponent` attribute adds this component if it’s not present.
- An animation clip that animates the properties of the GameObject. For example, a clip that animates the position and rotation of the GameObject.

## Add and run the script

To use the `PlayAnimationClip` script in your project, follow these steps:

1. Add a script component to your GameObject. Name the script file `PlayAnimationClip.cs` and use the following code: `using UnityEngine; using UnityEngine.Playables; using UnityEngine.Animations; [RequireComponent(typeof(Animator))] public class PlayAnimationClip : MonoBehaviour { public AnimationClip clip; PlayableGraph graph; void Start() { graph = PlayableGraph.Create("PlayAnimationClip"); graph.SetTimeUpdateMode(DirectorUpdateMode.GameTime); var output = AnimationPlayableOutput.Create(graph, "Animation", GetComponent<Animator>()); // Wrap the clip in a playable. var clipPlayable = AnimationClipPlayable.Create(graph, clip); // Connect the Playable to an output. output.SetSourcePlayable(clipPlayable); // Plays the Graph. graph.Play(); } void OnDisable() { // Destroys all Playables and PlayableOutputs created by the graph. graph.Destroy(); } }`
2. In the Script component, select the animation clip (`clip`) that the PlayableGraph will play at runtime.
3. Select **Play** to switch the Editor to Play mode.
4. If you have installed the PlayableGraph Visualizer package, select `PlayAnimationClip` to display the PlayableGraph:
