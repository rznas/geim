# Discrete collision detection

The **Discrete** **collision** detection mode uses a discrete **collision detection** algorithm, which checks for collisions on each physics timestep.

**Discrete** is the default collision detection mode, and by far the least computationally demanding. However, it can miss collisions that occur between physics steps, so it’s usually not suitable for fast-moving collisions.

If your collisions happen too quickly for discrete collision to pick them up, you can try one or both of the following solutions:

- Increase the frequency of physics timesteps. This can solve missed collisions for fast-moving objects, but comes with a high performance impact due to the extra calculations required.
- Use one of the continuous collision detection (CCD) modes. These can predict collisions that might occur between physics timesteps, but they also have a higher performance impact.

Experiment with both and profile the results to find the right solution for your project.
