# Choose and configure XR provider plug-ins

Use the XR Plug-in Management settings to choose and configure XR provider plug-ins.

Provider plug-ins are packages created to support XR devices and platforms. Use the **XR Plug-in Management** settings to manage which XR devices and platforms your project supports. You can also configure important settings for these XR provider plug-ins in this section.

To learn about the provider plug-ins Unity provides, refer to Provider plug-ins and XR provider plug-in framework.

The following sections outline how to Enable XR provider plug-ins, Configure provider plug-in settings, and Validate your project. For more information about the settings you can configure, refer to XR Plug-in Management settings.

## Prerequisites

Before you can enable XR plug-ins, you must install the [XR Plug-in Management](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.management@4.5/) package. You can install the package directly from the **Project Settings** window, as follows:

1. Open the **Project Settings** window (menu: **Edit > Project Settings**).
2. Select **XR Plug-in Management** from the list of settings areas along the left side of the settings window.   Before installing the XR Plug-in Management package
3. If necessary, click **Install XR Plug-in Management**.

### Install platform modules

Depending on the platforms your project targets, you might need to install additional platform modules (for example, Android or iOS) from the Unity Hub. Refer to [Add modules](https://docs.unity.com/hub/add-modules) in the Unity Hub documentation for instructions.

## Enable provider plug-ins

You must enable each provider plug-in your project targets using XR Plug-in Management.

To enable provider plug-ins:

1. Open the **Project Settings** window (menu: **Edit > Project Settings**).
2. Select **XR Plug-in Management** from the sections on the left side of the **Project Settings** window.
3. Select the tab for your target build platform. For example, to enable a plug-in for an Android device, click the tab with the Android icon .
4. Use the corresponding checkbox to enable your desired provider plug-in(s) from the list of **Plug-in Providers**.

When you enable a plug-in, XR Plug-in Management installs the associated package.

**Notes:**

- Disabling a provider doesn’t remove the package. To remove a provider plug-in, remove the associated package with the Package Manager.
- If a provider isn’t in the list, you might need to install the associated package with the Package Manager. Some device makers distribute their provider plug-in packages directly, rather than via Unity.

## Configure provider plug-in settings

For each enabled plug-in provider, you can configure provider-specific settings as follows:

1. In the XR Plug-in Management menu, select the name of the provider plug-in.
2. If present, select the tab for the platform build target. For example, to configure settings for Android devices, click the tab with the Android icon . (The tabs are only shown when a plug-in supports more than one build target.)
3. Configure the settings as required.

To learn about settings for a specific provider, refer to the documentation of the individual plug-in. You can access provider documentation from XR packages or with the **Documentation** link in the Package Manger, as shown in the following image:

## Validate your project

Some provider plug-ins and other packages implement project validation checks to help ensure that you’ve set up your project correctly. You can view the status of these checks in the **Project Validation** section under **XR Plug-in Management** in the **Project Settings** window.

If a validation check has a **Fix** button next to it, you can click the button to automatically fix the issue. Otherwise, you must fix the issue manually. Clicking **Edit** opens the settings UI to the appropriate section so that you can make any needed changes.

The way you resolve project validation issues depends on the severity of the issue:

- You must correct validation checks marked with a red stop icon.
- You can ignore or defer checks marked with a yellow warning icon, but fixing them results in better performance or compatibility.

To learn more about the validation system rules and status icons, refer to Project validation reference.
