# Trails module reference

Add trails to a percentage of your particles using this module.

## Properties

For some properties in this section, you can use different modes to set their value. For information on the modes you can use, refer to Vary Particle System properties over time.

| **Property:** | **Function:** |
| --- | --- |
| **Mode** | Choose how trails are generated for the Particle System.  - **Particle** mode creates an effect where each particle leaves a stationary trail in its path.  - **Ribbon** mode create a ribbon of trails connecting each particle based on its age. |
| **Ratio** | A value between 0 and 1, describing the proportion of particles that have a Trail assigned to them. Unity assigns trails randomly, so this value represents a probability. |
| **Lifetime** | The lifetime of each vertex in the Trail, expressed as a multiplier of the lifetime of the particle it belongs to. When each new vertex is added to the Trail, it disappears after it has been in existence longer than its total lifetime. |
| **Minimum Vertex Distance** | Define the distance a particle must travel before its Trail receives a new vertex. |
| **World Space** | When enabled, Trail vertices do not move relative to the **Particle System**’s **GameObject**, even if using **Local Simulation Space**. Instead, the Trail vertices are dropped in the world, and ignore any movement of the Particle System. |
| **Die With Particles** | If this box is checked, Trails vanish instantly when their particles die. If this box is not checked, the remaining Trail expires naturally based on its own remaining lifetime. |
| **Ribbon Count** | Choose how many ribbons to render throughout the Particle System. A value of 1 creates a single ribbon connecting each particle. However, a value higher than 1 creates ribbons that connect every Nth particle. For example, when using a value of 2, there will be one ribbon connecting particles 1, 3, 5, and another ribbon connecting particles 2, 4, 6, and so on. The ordering of the particles is decided based on their age. |
| **Split Sub Emitter Ribbons** | When enabled on a system that is being used as a sub-emitter, particles that were spawned from the same parent system particle share a ribbon. |
| **Texture Mode** | Choose how textures are applied to Particle Trails.  - **Stretch** mode stretches the texture along the entire length of the trail.  - **Tile** repeats the texture every N units of distance. The repeat rate is controlled based on the **Tiling** parameters in the **Material**.  - **Repeat per Segment** mode repeats the texture along the trail, repeating at a rate of once per trail segment. The repeat rate is controlled based on the **Tiling** parameters in the **Material**.  - **Distribute per Segment** mode maps the texture once along the entire length of the trail, and assumes that all vertices are evenly spaced. |
| **Size affects Width** | If enabled (the box is checked), the Trail width is multiplied by the particle size. |
| **Size affects Lifetime** | If enabled (the box is checked), the Trail lifetime is multiplied by the particle size. |
| **Inherit Particle Color** | If enabled (the box is checked), the Trail color is modulated by the particle color. |
| **Color over Lifetime** | A curve to control the color of the entire Trail over the lifetime of the particle it is attached to. |
| **Width over Trail** | A curve to control the width of the Trail over its length. |
| **Color over Trail** | A curve to control the color of the Trail over its length. |
| **Generate Lighting Data** | Enable this (check the box), to build the Trail geometry with Normals and Tangents included. This allows them to use Materials that use the **scene** lighting, for example via the Standard **Shader**, or by using a custom shader. |
| **Shadow Bias** | Move the shadows along the direction of the light. This removes shadowing artifacts caused by approximating volumes with billboarded trail geometry. |
