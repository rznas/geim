# Package layout for UPM packages

Explore the folder and file layout for Unity Package Manager (UPM) packages.

When you create the package structure, the Package Manager creates the following folder and file layout, which is consistent with **UPM packages** from the Unity Registry:

```
<package-root>
  ├── package.json
  ├── README.md
  ├── CHANGELOG.md
  ├── Third Party Notices.md
  ├── Editor
  │   ├── <organization-name>.<package-name>.Editor.asmdef
  │   └── EditorExample.cs
  ├── Runtime
  │   ├── <organization-name>.<package-name>.asmdef
  │   └── RuntimeExample.cs
  ├── Tests
  │   ├── Editor
  │   │   ├── <organization-name>.<package-name>.Editor.Tests.asmdef
  │   │   └── EditorExampleTest.cs
  │   └── Runtime
  │        ├── <organization-name>.<package-name>.Tests.asmdef
  │        └── RuntimeExampleTest.cs
  ├── Samples
  │        ├── Example
  │        └── ...
  └── Documentation
       └── <package-name>.md
```

| **File or folder** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| `package.json` | The package manifest, which defines the package dependencies and other metadata. |
| `README.md` | Developer package documentation. This documentation helps developers who want to change the package or push a new change on the package’s main branch. |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | Description of package changes in reverse chronological order. It’s good practice to use a standard format, like [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/). |
| `Third Party Notices.md` | Contains information that’s required to meet legal requirements for third-party code or dynamic link libraries (DLL) used in your package. |
| `Editor/` | Contains assets (which can include scripts and libraries) for tools and utilities used in the Unity Editor. Unlike folders under the project’s `Assets` folder, this is only a convention and doesn’t affect the asset import pipeline. Refer to Create or edit the assembly definitions to configure Editor-specific assemblies in this folder. |
| `Runtime/` | Contains assets (which can include scripts and libraries) for tools and utilities used at runtime. This is only a convention and doesn’t affect the asset import pipeline. Refer to Assembly definition and packages to configure runtime assemblies in this folder. |
| `Tests/` | Folder to store any tests included in the package. |
| `Tests/Editor/` | Editor platform-specific tests folder. Refer to Create or edit the assembly definitions to configure Editor-specific test assemblies in this folder. |
| `Tests/Runtime/` | Runtime platform-specific tests. Refer to Create or edit the assembly definitions to configure runtime test assemblies in this folder. |
| `Samples/` | Folder to store any samples included in the package. |
| `Documentation/` | Folder to store any documentation included in the package. |

**Note**: The **Create package** function names the `Documentation` and `Samples` folders without a trailing tilde (`~`). This differs from packages installed from the Unity registry, where the included tilde hides these folders in the **Project** window. When you export your UPM package, Unity automatically adds the tilde to the `Samples` folder to match the behavior of registry packages. For more information about hidden assets, refer to Reserved folder name reference.
