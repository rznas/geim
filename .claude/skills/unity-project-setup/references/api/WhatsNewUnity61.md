## 2D

Enabled auto-generation of **Tilemap** assets in PSD Importer and Aseprite Importer, so that you can start authoring 2D worlds more quickly.

The new Tile Set asset provides generative capabilities for existing **Sprite** Texture assets, where you only need to set up the asset initially. Changes to the source propagate down automatically.

To learn more, refer to Tile Set documentation.

## Bug Reporter

Updated the Bug Reporter for Unity 6.1 to be more stable, have a smoother UI, and a new dark mode. The Bug Reporter uses a new framework to make it more robust and future proof in native systems. The Bug Reporter now has an Apple Silicon native client, meaning we have removed our reliance on Rosetta for support.

The Bug Reporter now also links to the Hub. If you are logged in through the Hub, all of your credentials are forwarded automatically, so it is easier than ever to submit any issues you come across in the Unity Editor.

## Editor and workflow

This section outlines recent updates to the Editor and its general workflows.

### Choose a save location for scripts created from the Inspector

Creating a new script from the **Add Component** menu now opens a dialog where you can choose a save location for the new script.

### Updates to the main menu

Reorganized the submenus in the following main menu items to be more navigable:

- **Edit**
- **Assets**
- **Component**
- **Window**
- **Help**

In addition, made the following changes in these menus:

- **Edit**: Moved **Undo History** from **Edit** to **Window** > **General**.
- **Assets**: Renamed **Extract from **Prefab**** to **Extract Material Subasset**. This menu item is disabled if you do not have a material asset selected in the **Project** window.
- **Component**: Moved most items from the **Miscellaneous** submenu to more appropriate submenus that better indicate their type. This move affects the **Add Component** **Inspector** interface as well.
- **Window**:
  - Added a new **Package Management** submenu that contains the Package Manager, **Asset Store**, Services, and My Assets windows.
  - Moved the ****Version Control**** menu item to a **Version Control** submenu and renamed it to **External Provider**. This might affect user-defined keyboard shortcuts or **scripts** that rely on menu item paths.
- **Help**: On macOS, **Check For Updates** is now in the **Unity Menu**.

## Graphics

This section outlines recent updates to Unity’s graphics systems.

### Reduce shader variants in URP

If your project uses the Universal **Render Pipeline** (URP), you can now reduce the number of shader variants Unity compiles for fog and **level of detail** meshes (LODs). This helps reduce build times, file size, **shader** loading times, and runtime memory usage.

For more information, refer to the following:

- Strip fog shader variants in URP
- Strip level of detail (LOD) shader variants in URP

### Reduce shader stuttering with pipeline state object (PSO) tracing

To reduce stuttering caused by shader compilation, you can now use the experimental `GraphicsStateCollection` API. Use the API to trace the pipeline state objects (PSOs) the graphics API needs and compile them ahead-of-time. For more information, refer to Prewarm shaders.

### Bicubic lightmap sampling in URP and HDRP

Added a **Use Bicubic **Lightmap** Sampling** setting to URP and HDRP graphics settings to improve the visual fidelity of lightmaps by smoothing sharp or jagged edges, especially at the edges of shadows. For more information, refer to Improve the visual fidelity of lightmaps.

### DirectX 12 as the default graphics API

DirectX 12 is now the default graphics API for new projects targeting the Windows platform. You can still use DirectX 11 for your project if needed.

### Read/write texture support in custom HLSL

Added support for read/write graphics buffers and textures as input parameters to the Custom HLSL Block and Operator. This allows VFX to write into custom buffers without relying on global bindings. For more information, refer to Custom HLSL Nodes (block and operator).

### Runtime and compilation optimizations

Added VFX performance optimizations for both the Editor and runtime:

- Optimized **particle** data layout for reduced bandwidth usage and smaller memory footprint.
- Improved parallelization in the VFX runtime for faster CPU execution and less main thread computation.
- Reduced garbage creation during shader source generation, resulting in faster import and authoring times.

### Instancing support for GPU events

Added instancing support for GPU events, so VFX using GPU events no longer disables instancing by force. This simulates and renders many instances of VFX with GPU events more efficiently as batches.

### Deferred+ rendering path

Added Deferred+ as a supported **rendering path** in URP. The Deferred+ rendering path, like the Deferred rendering path, has no limit on the number of lights that can affect an opaque **GameObject**, but uses Forward+ instead of Forward for the transparent and forward only opaque pass. Refer to Deferred+ rendering paths in URP for more information.

### HDRP

This section outlines recent updates to the High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP).

#### Enhanced performance with Variable Rate Shading

Added Variable Rate Shading (VRS) support for custom passes to optimize shading performance. You can now dynamically adjust the shading resolution in specific areas of the screen. This helps reduce GPU workload while maintaining visual quality. For more information, refer to the ShadingRateImage and the ShadingRateInfo API documentation.

#### 3D deformation for Water System

Added support for horizontal deformations in the Water Decal system’s deformation output. Previously, you could only modify the vertical position of Water Surface vertices. With this feature, you can create more complex effects like rolling waves. For more information, refer to the Rolling Wave **scene** in the HDRP Water Samples package and Deform a water surface vertically.

#### New water sample scene with caustics and deformation effects

Added a new water sample cave scene that showcases a Custom Pass and a Local Volumetric Fog sampling the Water System caustics buffer to demonstrate advanced water rendering techniques. For more information, refer to Caustics in the water system.

## Raytracing API

This section outlines recent updates to Unity’s raytracing API.

### Manual control over ray-tracing acceleration updates

Added the `RayTracingAccelerationStructure.UpdateInstanceGeometry` API. You can now manually trigger updates to the Bottom-Level Acceleration Structure (BLAS). This gives you greater control over when and how geometry updates occur in ray-traced scenes. As a result, you can manage resources more efficiently and improve performance in dynamic environments. For more information, refer to the API documentation.

### Efficient instance management

Added the new `RayTracingAccelerationStructure.AddInstancesIndirect` API. You can now specify ray-tracing instance transformation matrices using a GraphicsBuffer. As a result, you can manage large numbers of ray-traced instances more efficiently, particularly in dynamic or procedurally generated scenes. For more information, refer to the API documentation.

### Flexible ray-tracing instance removal

Added the new `RayTracingAccelerationStructure.RemoveInstance` API. You can now remove ray-tracing instances from an acceleration structure based on their layer or ray-tracing mode. As a result, you can manage dynamic scenes, especially those requiring frequent instance updates, more flexibly and efficiently. For more information, refer to the API documentation.

### More efficient ray-tracing instance management

Added the `RayTracingAccelerationStructure.CullInstances` API. Using various filtering and culling parameters, you can now populate the acceleration structure with ray-tracing instances associated with renderers in the scene. As a result, you can more easily update the acceleration structure based on scene visibility and rendering criteria. For more information, refer to the API documentation.

## Platforms
