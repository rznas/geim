# Wind reference

| **Property** | **Function** |
| --- | --- |
| **Mode: Directional** | The **Wind Zone** affects the entire **scene** and blows in one direction. This is the default mode. |
| **Mode: Spherical** | The Wind Zone only has an effect inside the radius, and has a falloff from the center towards the edge. |
| **Radius** | Wind Zone size (active only if the mode is Spherical). |
| **Main** | The primary force applied to all objects the Wind Zone affects. The numerical value is the wind speed; the plus and minus signs are the direction. If the value is 0, but **Turbulence** has a value other than 0, the trees still move. If both **Main** and **Turbulence** are 0, the trees bend, but they don’t move - they stay in a static bent position. |
| **Turbulence** | Represents the noise applied to the wind speed. A greater value creates higher variation in wind speed. If **Turbulence** isn’t 0, there’s wind even if **Main** is 0. If **Turbulence** is 0, there’s no wind even if **Main** has a value other than 0. |
| **Pulse Magnitude** | Pulses create the appearance of gusts of wind that are stronger than the main wind. **Magnitude** is a multiplier of **Main**, meaning if **Main** and **Turbulence** are both 0 the pulses are also 0. |
| **Pulse Frequency** | How frequent pulses are, and how long they last. More frequent pulses are shorter. |
