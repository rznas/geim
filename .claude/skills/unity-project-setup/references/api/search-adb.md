# Search the Asset Database

The Asset Database search provider finds items in the Asset Database, which stores converted files and their data. It’s equivalent to using the `AssetDatabase.FindAsset` API.

**Note:** By default, the Asset Database provider is inactive. To enable it, refer to Activate and deactivate search providers.

**Tip:** You can use the Asset Database provider in the general **Search** window, or in a specialised window. To open a specialized search window for the Asset Database provider, from the main menu, select **Window** > **Search** > **Asset Database**.

## Query syntax

Provider token: `adb`

Query example: Find all light assets with `low` in their name.

```
adb: t:light low
```

## Implicit Files search

You can include results from the built-in Unity Editor resources.

For more information, refer to Show more results section of the Search for files page.

## Provider filters

The Asset Database provider has additional filters in the visual query builder. This table lists the filters and their textual query equivalents.

| Filter | Search token | Query example | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Type** | `t:<type>` | `t:script` | Find all script files. |
| **Component** | `t:<component>` | `t:TerrainGroup` | Find all assets that have a component with a TerrainGroup script. |
| **Label** | `l:<label>` | `adb: l:monster` | Find all assets with the label `monster`. |
| **Area (All, Assets, Packages)** | `a:<assets/packages/all>` | `adb: a:assets t:Material` | Find all materials in the Assets folder; this excludes assets from packages. Options: **All**, **Assets** (exclude packages), **Packages** (exclude the Assets folder). |
| **Glob** | `glob:<pattern>` | `adb: glob:"Assets/**/*.png"` | Runs a glob query, which pattern-matches against file names. In this example, find all `png` files in the Assets subfolders. For more information, refer to Search files. |
| **Referencing Asset (ID, path, or name)** | `adb:ref:Assets/Trees/Prefab/Pine.prefab` | Find **GameObjects** referencing an asset by its name, exact path, or `GlobalObjectId`. |  |
| **Asset bundle name** | `b:<assetBundleName>` | `adb: b:materialAssetBundle` | Find all assets within the asset bundle `materialAssetBundle`. |

If you don’t know the asset’s ID, use this filter as part of a visual query, where you’re able to choose the referenced asset from a list. If you need a textual query, you can convert the visual query to a textual one. For more information, refer to Launch and use the search window.

To get an asset’s exact path, right-click the asset in the **Project** window and select **Copy Path**.

Another way to find references is with the context (right-click) menu:

- **Project** window: right-click an asset and select **Find References In **Scene**** or **Find References In Project**.
- **Hierarchy** window: right-click a GameObject and select **Find References In Scene**.
- ****Inspector**** window: right-click a component and select **Find References In Scene**.

## Results

**Search** window tab: **Resources**.

## Actions

The context menu for the Asset Database search provider includes the following actions:

| Action | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Select** | Open the asset in the **Inspector** and **Project** windows. This is the default double-click action. To change the default action, refer to Preferences. |
| **Open** | Open the asset in the Unity Editor or an external editor. |
| **Reimport** | For imported assets, reimports the asset from the source file. |
| **Reveal** | Opens the asset in your operating system’s file browser. |
| **Delete** | Deletes the asset. The Unity Editor requests confirmation before deleting. |
| **Copy Path** | Copies the asset’s path relative to your project’s root folder to the clipboard. |
| **Copy GUID** | Copies the asset’s GUID to the clipboard. |
| **Properties** | Opens a **Focused inspector** window for the asset. |
