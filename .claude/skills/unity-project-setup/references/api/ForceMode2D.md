### Description

Option for how to apply a force using Rigidbody2D.AddForce.

Use this to apply a certain type of force to a 2D RigidBody. There are two types of forces to apply: Force mode and Impulse Mode. For a 3D Rigidbody see ForceMode.

```csharp
//This script adds force to a Rigidbody. The kind of force is determined by which buttons you click.//Create a Sprite and attach a Rigidbody2D component to it
//Attach this script to the Spriteusing UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.EventSystems;public class AddingForce : MonoBehaviour
{
    //Use to switch between Force Modes
    enum ModeSwitching { Start, Impulse, Force };
    ModeSwitching m_ModeSwitching;    //Use this to change the different kinds of force
    ForceMode2D m_ForceMode;
    //Start position of the RigidBody, use to reset
    Vector2 m_StartPosition;    //Use to apply force to RigidBody
    Vector2 m_NewForce;    //Use to manipulate the RigidBody of a GameObject
    Rigidbody2D m_Rigidbody;    void Start()
    {
        //Fetch the RigidBody component attached to the GameObject
        m_Rigidbody = GetComponent<Rigidbody2D>();
        //Start at first mode (nothing happening yet)
        m_ModeSwitching = ModeSwitching.Start;        //Initialising the force to use on the RigidBody in various ways
        m_NewForce = new Vector2(-5.0f, 1.0f);        //This is the RigidBody's starting position
        m_StartPosition = m_Rigidbody.transform.position;
    }    void Update()
    {
        //Switching modes depending on button presses
        switch (m_ModeSwitching)
        {
            //This is the starting mode which resets the GameObject
            case ModeSwitching.Start:                //Reset to starting position of RigidBody
                m_Rigidbody.transform.position = m_StartPosition;
                //Reset the velocity of the RigidBody
                m_Rigidbody.linearVelocity = new Vector2(0f, 0f);
                break;            //This is the Force Mode
            case ModeSwitching.Force:
                //Make the GameObject travel upwards
                m_NewForce = new Vector2(0, 1.0f);
                //Use Force mode as force on the RigidBody
                m_Rigidbody.AddForce(m_NewForce, ForceMode2D.Force);
                break;            //This is the Impulse Mode
            case ModeSwitching.Impulse:
                //Make the GameObject travel upwards
                m_NewForce = new Vector2(0f, 1.0f);
                //Use Impulse mode as a force on the RigidBody
                m_Rigidbody.AddForce(m_NewForce, ForceMode2D.Impulse);
                break;
        }
    }    //These are the Buttons for telling what Force to apply as well as resetting
    void OnGUI()
    {
        //If reset button pressed
        if (GUI.Button(new Rect(100, 0, 150, 30), "Reset"))
        {
            //Switch to start/reset case            m_ModeSwitching = ModeSwitching.Start;
        }        //Impulse button pressed
        if (GUI.Button(new Rect(100, 60, 150, 30), "Apply Impulse"))
        {
            //Switch to Impulse mode (apply impulse forces to GameObject)            m_ModeSwitching = ModeSwitching.Impulse;
        }        //Force Button Pressed
        if (GUI.Button(new Rect(100, 90, 150, 30), "Apply Force"))
        {
            //Switch to Force mode (apply force to GameObject)
            m_ModeSwitching = ModeSwitching.Force;
        }
    }
}
