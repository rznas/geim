### Returns

**string** The string representation of the `GlobalObjectId`.

### Description

Obtains the string representation of the unique object identifier.

The string representation of a `GlobalObjectId` can be serialized, then used at a later time to re-initialize a `GlobalObjectID` struct.

The format of the string representation of the ID is `GlobalObjectId_V1-{i}-{a}-{l}-{p}`, where:

- `{i}` is the identifier type represented by an integer (0 = Null, 1 = Imported Asset, 2 = Scene Object, 3 = Source Asset).
- `{a}` is the asset GUID. This is a globally unique identifier that Unity assigns to every newly discovered asset. For more information, refer to Asset Metadata in the Manual.
- `{l}` is the local file ID of the object. For objects inside a prefab instance, this ID is the local file ID of the original source object that is part of the prefab. For more information, refer to GlobalObjectId.targetObjectId.
- `{p}` is the local file ID of the prefab instance of the object. If the object isn't part of a prefab instance, then `{p}` is `0`.

**Note**: Actual local file IDs are signed 64-bit values and can be negative. But in a `GlobalObjectId`, these values are cast to GlobalObjectId.targetObjectId, which is an unsigned 64-bit value (`ulong`). Therefore, a negative local file ID will lose its sign when saved to a `GlobalObjectId` and you should not rely on the value of `targetObjectId`, or the `{l}` element from the string representation of a GlobalObjectID, to find an object.
