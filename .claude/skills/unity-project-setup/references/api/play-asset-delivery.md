# Play Asset Delivery

Play Asset Delivery (PAD) is the asset splitting solution for the [Android App Bundle](https://developer.android.com/guide/app-bundle) (AAB) publishing format. PAD uses asset packs to store additional assets such as textures, sounds, and meshes. Google hosts and serves asset packs on Google Play, which means you don’t need to create a content delivery network to send application resources to users. For more information about PAD, refer to Android documentation on [Play Asset Delivery](https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/asset-delivery).

PAD is only available for Google Play and enables applications to be larger than the Google Play application size limit of 200MB.

**Important**: If you have a large application and want to publish it to digital distribution services that don’t support the AAB publishing format, you must use the **APK** publishing format and APK expansion files.
