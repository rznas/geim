# Project manifest file

When Unity loads a project, the Unity Package Manager reads the **project manifest** so that it can compute a list of which packages to retrieve and load. When a user installs or uninstalls a package through the Package Manager window, the Package Manager stores those changes in the project manifest file. The project manifest file manages the list of packages through the dependencies object.

In addition, the project manifest serves as a configuration file for the Package Manager, which uses the manifest to customize the registry URL and register custom registries.

You can find the project manifest file, called `manifest.json`, in the `Packages` folder under the root folder of your Unity project. Like the package manifest file, the project manifest file uses JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) syntax.

## Properties

All properties are optional. However, if your project manifest file does not contain any values, the Package Manager window doesn’t load, and the Package Manager doesn’t load any packages.

| **Key** | **JSON Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **dependencies** | Object | Collection of packages required for your project. This includes only direct dependencies (indirect dependencies are listed in package manifests). Each entry maps the package name to the minimum version required for the project:   `{`  `"dependencies": {`  `"com.my-package": "2.3.1",`  `"com.my-other-package": "1.0.1-preview.1",`  `etc.`  `}` `}`  Specifying a version number indicates that you want the Package Manager to download the package from the package registry (that is, the source of the package is the registry). However, in addition to using versions, you can also specify a path to a local folder or tarball file, or a Git URL.   **Note**: You do not need to specify embedded packages here because the Package Manager finds them inside your project’s `Packages` folder and loads them automatically. The Package Manager ignores any entry if there is an embedded package with the same name in its own package manifest. |
| **enableLockFile** | Boolean | Enables a lock file to ensure that dependencies are resolved in a deterministic manner. This is set to `true` by default. For more information, see Using lock files. |
| **resolutionStrategy** | String | Upgrades indirect dependencies based on Semantic Versioning rules. This is set to `lowest` by default. For more information, see Setting a resolution strategy below. |
| **scopedRegistries** | Array of Objects | Specify custom registries in addition to the default registry. This allows you to host your own packages.   Refer to Scoped Registries for more details. |
| **testables** | Array of Strings | Lists the names of packages whose tests you want to load in the Unity [Test Framework](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.test-framework@latest). For more information, see Adding tests to a package.  **Note**: You do not need to specify embedded packages here because the Unity Test Framework assumes they are testable by default. |
| **pinnedPackages** | Array of Strings | Lists the names of packages that you want to lock at the version specified in the `dependencies` object. Items in this list must exist in the `dependencies` object, otherwise an error is generated.  Adding package names to this list makes Package Manager use the exact package version specified in the `dependencies` object, even if a different package version is more compatible with your version of the Unity Editor. |

## Example

```
{
  "scopedRegistries": [{
    "name": "My internal registry",
    "url": "https://my.internal.registry.com",
    "scopes": [
      "com.company"
    ]
  }],
  "dependencies": {
    "com.unity.package-1": "1.0.0",
    "com.unity.package-2": "2.0.0",
    "com.company.my-package": "3.0.0",
    "com.unity.my-local-package": "file:<path>/my_package_folder",
    "com.unity.my-local-tarball": "file:<path>/my_package_tarball.tgz",
    "com.unity.my-git-package": "https://my.repository/my-package.git#v1.2.3"
  },
  "enableLockFile": true,
  "resolutionStrategy": "highestMinor",
  "testables": [ "com.unity.package-1", "com.unity.package-2" ],
  "pinnedPackages": ["com.unity.package-1"]
}
```

## Setting a resolution strategy

While you can force Unity’s package dependency resolution to use higher versions of indirect dependencies by adding them explicitly to the project manifest, this isn’t a good strategy, for two reasons:

- It puts more responsibility on the project owner to maintain dependency versions.
- Over time, you might have dependencies that are not required by the project.

A better approach is to customize how the Package Manager selects indirect dependencies based on Semantic Versioning rules by setting the **resolutionStrategy** property:

| **Value:** | **Description:** |
| --- | --- |
| **lowest** | Do not upgrade indirect dependencies. Instead, it uses exactly the requested version. This is the default mode. |
| **highestPatch** | Upgrade to the highest version with the same Major and Minor components. For example, with the requested version 1.2.3, this strategy selects the highest version in the range `[1.2.3, 1.3.0)` (that is, `>= 1.2.3` and `< 1.3.0`). |
| **highestMinor** | Upgrade to the highest version with the same Major component. For example, with the requested version 1.2.3, this strategy selects the highest version in the range `[1.2.3, 2.0.0)` (that is, `>= 1.2.3` and `< 2.0.0`).  **Note**: Version `1.0.0` marks the first stable, production-ready version. Below that, versions `0.X.Y` indicate that their API is not yet stable, and successive minor versions might introduce breaking changes. This part of the SemVer specification allows releasing early versions of a package without hampering rapid development. Because of this, when the target version is `0.X.Y`, **highestMinor** behaves like **highestPatch** in order to ensure choosing a backward-compatible version. For example, with the requested version `0.1.3`, this strategy selects the highest version in the range `[0.1.3,0.2.0)`. |
| **highest** | Upgrade to the highest version. For example, with the requested version 1.2.3, this strategy selects the highest version in the range `[1.2.3,)` (that is, `>= 1.2.3` with no upper bound) |

**Note**: These ranges never allow a dependency to jump from a stable release to an experimental or pre-release package.
