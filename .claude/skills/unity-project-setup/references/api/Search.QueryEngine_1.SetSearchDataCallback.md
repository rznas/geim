### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| getSearchDataCallback | Callback used to get the data to be matched against the search words. Takes an object of type TData and returns an IEnumerable of strings. |
| stringComparison | String comparison options. |

### Description

Sets the callback used to fetch the data that is matched against the search words.

This function lets you register a callback that will be called on each element of the data set you are trying to filter, in order to retrieve the search data that will be compared against search words (for example, words that are not filters). Here is an example:

```csharp
// Set up what data from objects of type MyObjectType will be matched against search words
queryEngine.SetSearchDataCallback(myObj => new[] { myObj.id.ToString(), myObj.name });
```

For a more complete example on how to use this function, see QueryEngine.

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| getSearchDataCallback | Callback used to get the data to be matched against the search words. Takes an object of type TData and returns an IEnumerable of strings. |
| searchWordTransformerCallback | Callback used to transform a search word during the query parsing. Useful when doing lowercase or uppercase comparison. Can return null or an empty string to remove the word from the query. |
| stringComparison | String comparison options. |

### Description

Sets the callback used to fetch the data that is matched against the search words.

This function lets you register a callback that will be called on each element of the data set you are trying to filter, in order to retrieve the search data that will be compared against search words (for example, words that are not filters). Also, it gives you tha ability to apply a transformation on the search words themselves to prepare the comparison. This transformation is only done once when the query is parsed.

        // Set the search data callback with a word transformer.
        // The word transformer will make sure that the words used for comparison are already converted to lowercase,
        // which will increase performance by doing comparisons with Ordinal instead of OrdinalIgnoreCase
        queryEngine.SetSearchDataCallback(myObj => new[] { myObj.id.ToString(), myObj.name }, word => word.ToLowerInvariant(), StringComparison.Ordinal);
