# Retarget Humanoid animations

One of the most powerful features of Mecanim is the ability to retarget **humanoid animations**. This means that you can apply the same set of animations to different character models. **Retargeting** is only possible for humanoid models with a configured **Avatar**. A configured avatar provides the ability to correspondence between the models’ bone structure.

## Recommended Hierarchy structure

When working with Mecanim animations, you can expect your **scene** to contain the following elements:

- The Imported character model, which has an Avatar on it.
- The **Animator Component**, referencing an **Animator Controller** asset.
- A set of **animation clips**, referenced from the Animator Controller.
- **Scripts** for the character.
- Character-related components, such as the **Character Controller**.

Your project should also contain another character model with a valid Avatar.

To retarget between character models, follow these steps:

1. Create a **GameObject** in the Hierarchy that contains Character-related components.   The MainChar GameObject with its Character Controller component.
2. Put the model as a child of the GameObject, together with the Animator component.   The child Kyle_Robot GameObject with its Animator Controller component.
3. Make sure scripts referencing the Animator are looking for the animator in the children instead of the root. To do this, use `GetComponentInChildren<Animator>()` instead of `GetComponent<Animator>()`.   The Kyle_Robot character.

Then, to reuse the same animations on another model, do the following:

1. Disable the original model.
2. Drop in the desired model as another child of GameObject.   The child Teddy GameObject with its Animator Controller component set to no controller.
3. Make sure the Animator Controller property for the new model is referencing the same controller asset.   The Teddy GameObject with its Animator Controller set to the same controller as the Kyle GameObject.
4. Tweak the character controller, the transform, and other properties on the top-level GameObject to make sure that the animations work smoothly with the new model.   The Teddy character.
