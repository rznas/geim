# Assign tags to GameObjects

A tag is a reference word which you can assign to one or more **GameObjects**. For example, you might define “Player” tags for player-controlled characters and an “Enemy” tag for non-player-controlled characters. You might define items the player can collect in a **Scene** with a “Collectable” tag. You can use any word you want as a tag. You can even use short phrases, but you might need to widen the Inspector to see the tag’s full name. A GameObject can only have one tag assigned to it.

Tags help you identify GameObjects for scripting purposes. They ensure you don’t need to manually add GameObjects to a script’s exposed properties with drag and drop, so you save time when you use the same script code in multiple GameObjects.

Tags are useful for triggers in Collider control **scripts** that need to determine if the player interacts with an enemy, a prop, or a collectable, for example.

You can use the GameObject.FindWithTag function to find any GameObject that contains a tag you specify. The following example uses `GameObject.FindWithTag()`. It instantiates `respawnPrefab` at the location of GameObjects with the “Respawn” tag.

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;

public class Example : MonoBehaviour {
    public GameObject respawnPrefab;
    public GameObject respawn;
    void Start() {
        if (respawn == null)
            respawn = GameObject.FindWithTag("Respawn");

        Instantiate(respawnPrefab, respawn.transform.position, respawn.transform.rotation) as GameObject;
    }
}
```

## Create new Tags

The **Inspector** displays the **Tag** and **Layer** dropdown menus below the name of a GameObject.

To create a new tag, select **Add Tag…**. This opens the Tag and Layer Manager in the Inspector. Once you name a tag, it can’t be renamed later.

Layers are similar to tags, but are used to define how Unity renders GameObjects in the Scene. Refer to documentation on the Layers page for more information.

## Apply a Tag

The **Inspector** shows the **Tag** and **Layer** dropdown menus just below the name of a GameObject. To apply an existing tag to a GameObject, open the **Tags** dropdown and choose the tag you want to apply. The GameObject is now associated with this tag.

## Understand built-in tags

The Editor includes the following built-in tags which don’t appear in the Tag Manager:

- **Untagged**
- **Respawn**
- **Finish**
- **EditorOnly**
- **MainCamera**
- **Player**
- **GameController**

Some built-in tags like **MainCamera** and **EditorOnly** have unique functions.

The Editor caches GameObjects tagged with the **MainCamera** tag internally. When you access Camera.main, the Editor returns the first valid result from its cache. Refer to Camera.main to learn more.

A GameObject tagged with **EditorOnly** in a Scene is destroyed when the game builds. Any child GameObjects of a GameObject tagged with **EditorOnly** are also destroyed when the game builds.
