# Uses of layers in Unity

You can use layers to optimize your project and workflow. Common uses of layers include:

- Layer-based rendering
- Layer-based collision

## Use the Camera culling mask with layers

You can render only the objects in a particular layer, or selection of layers, if you use the **Camera**’s **culling mask**. To change the culling mask, select the camera you want to use, and select the **Culling Mask** dropdown in the **Inspector** window. If you clear the checkbox of a layer, it doesn’t render in the **scene**.

**Note**: UI elements and screen space canvas children are exceptions to this and render regardless.

## Ray cast with layers

You can use layers to specify which GameObjects that a ray cast can intersect with. To make a ray cast ignore a **GameObject**, you can assign it to the Ignore Raycast layer, or pass a LayerMask to the ray cast API call.

If you don’t pass a LayerMask to the ray cast API call, Unity uses Physics.DefaultRaycastLayers which matches every layer except Ignore Raycast.

The Physics.Raycast function uses a bitmask, and each bit determines if a layer is ignored by rays or not. If all bits in the layerMask are on, the ray collides against all **colliders**. If the layerMask = 0, there are no **collisions**.

For example, if you want to cast a ray on layer 8, see the code sample below:

```
int layerMask = 1 << 8;

// Does the ray intersect any objects which are in layer 8?
if (Physics.Raycast(transform.position, Vector3.forward, Mathf.Infinity, layerMask))
{
    Debug.Log("The ray hit the player");
}
```

You can then do the inverse, so that the ray collides with all layers except layer 8.

```
void Update ()
{
    // Bit shift the index of the layer (8) to get a bit mask
    int layerMask = 1 << 8;

    // This casts rays only against colliders in layer 8.
    // But to collide against everything except layer 8, use the ~ operator because it inverts a bitmask.
    layerMask = ~layerMask;

    RaycastHit hit;
    // Does the ray intersect any objects excluding layer 8.
    if (Physics.Raycast(transform.position, transform.TransformDirection (Vector3.forward), out hit, Mathf.Infinity, layerMask))
    {
        Debug.DrawRay(transform.position, transform.TransformDirection (Vector3.forward) * hit.distance, Color.yellow);
        Debug.Log("Did Hit");
    }
    else
    {
        Debug.DrawRay(transform.position, transform.TransformDirection (Vector3.forward) *1000, Color.white);
        Debug.Log("Did not Hit");
    }
}
```

**Note**: If you don’t pass a layerMask to the Raycast function, it still ignores colliders that use the IgnoreRaycast layer.
