# Use a scoped registry in your project

Add a scoped registry to your project to access custom packages.

## Integrity and security of scoped registries

Whenever you add a scoped registry to your project, use the same level of caution that you use when installing any other third-party software:

- Install scoped registries only from trusted sources, because the packages in those registries can contain executable code.
- Beware of third-party registries that might be harmful or capture data without appropriate controls. Also beware of third parties that falsely claim to be Unity or to have Unity’s approval or support.

## Manage scoped registries for a project

You can use the Project Settings window or the project manifest file to manage scoped registries in your project.

### Manage scoped registries with the Project Settings window

You can add, modify, and remove a scoped registry for your project in the Package Manager panel within the **Project Settings** window. The **Scoped Registries** group displays a list of scoped registries added to the current project on the left of the settings group, and the details of the selected registry on the right.

#### Add a registry

To add a new scoped registry to your project by using the Package Manager panel of the **Project Settings** window:

1. Select the **Add (+)** button at the bottom of the list of scoped registries. A new entry appears in the list as **New Scoped Registry** with blank values for the details on the right.
2. Enter values for the Name, URL, and Scope(s) properties.
3. If you want to specify more than one scope, select the **Add (+)** button underneath the last **Scope(s)** value to display another **Scope(s)** text field.
4. After you enter the information for the selected scoped registry, select **Save**. To cancel adding the new scoped registry, select **Cancel**.

**Note**: You might experience one or more of the following issues when you add a scoped registry:

- The **My Registries** context doesn’t display in the navigation panel.
- The scoped registry isn’t listed under the **My Registries** context.

These issues might occur because because the package registry server you added doesn’t implement the `/-/v1/search` or `/-/all` endpoints. Unity’s Package Manager requires these endpoints.

#### Modify a registry

To modify an existing scoped registry by using the Package Manager panel of the **Project Settings** window:

1. Select the registry you want to modify from the list on the left. The information for the existing scoped registry displays on the right.
2. Modify any of the Name, URL, and Scope(s) properties.
3. After you update the information for the selected scoped registry, select **Apply**. To cancel your updates, select **Revert**.

#### Remove a registry

To delete an existing scoped registry by using the Package Manager panel of the **Project Settings** window:

1. Select the registry you want to delete from the list.
2. Select the **Remove (-)** button underneath the list. A dialog prompts you to confirm the removal.
3. Select **OK** to remove the registry or **Cancel** to leave it intact.

### Manage scoped registries with the project manifest file

The project manifest uses a scopedRegistries property, which contains an array of scoped registry configuration objects. Each object has the following properties:

| **Property** | **JSON Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **name** | String | The scope name as it appears in the user interface. The Package Manager window displays this name in the details panel.   For example, `"name": "Tools"`. |
| **url** | String | The URL to the npm-compatible registry server.   For example, `"url": "https://mycompany.example.com/tools-registry"`  **Note**: Not all registry providers are compatible with Unity’s Package Manager. Make sure the package registry server you’re trying to add implements the `/-/v1/search` or `/-/all` endpoints. |
| **scopes** | Array of strings | Array of scopes that you can map to a package name, either as an exact match on the package name, or as a namespace. Wildcards and other glob patterns aren’t supported.  For example, `"scopes": [ "com.example", "com.example.tools.physics" ]`   **Note**: This configuration type assumes that packages follow the [Reverse domain name notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_domain_name_notation). This ensures that `com.unity` is equivalent to any package name that matches the `com.unity` namespace, such as `com.unity.timeline` or `com.unity.2d.animation`.  **Warning:** Unity doesn’t support npm’s `@scope` notation. |

#### Project manifest example

In the following project manifest, there are two scoped registries, `General` and `Tools`:

```
{
    "scopedRegistries": [
        {
            "name": "General",
            "url": "https://example.com/registry",
            "scopes": [
                "com.example", "com.example.tools.physics"
            ]
        },
        {
            "name": "Tools",
            "url": "https://mycompany.example.com/tools-registry",
            "scopes": [
                "com.example.mycompany.tools"
            ]
        }
    ],
    "dependencies": {
        "com.unity.animation": "1.0.0",
        "com.example.mycompany.tools.animation": "1.0.0",
        "com.example.tools.physics": "1.0.0",
        "com.example.animation": "1.0.0"
    }
}
```

When the Package Manager decides which registry to fetch a package from, it compares the package `name` to the `scopes` values and finds the registry whose `scopes` value is the closest match. The following scenarios show the logic that the Package Manager uses when assessing the `General` and `Tools` registries from the previous JSON file:

- When the Package Manager looks up the `com.example.animation` package, it finds that the `com.example` namespace is the closest match to its name, and fetches that package from the `General` registry.
- When the Package Manager looks up the `com.example.tools.physics` package, the `General` registry has a scope that exactly matches the package name.
- When the Package Manager looks up the `com.example.mycompany.tools.animation` package, the Package Manager finds that the `com.example.mycompany.tools` namespace is the closest match to its name and fetches that package from the `Tools` registry. Although it also matches the `General` scope, the `com.example` namespace isn’t as close a match.
- When the Package Manager looks up the `com.unity.animation` package, the Package Manager doesn’t find a match in any of the scoped registries. In this case, it fetches the package from the default registry.

## Import scoped registries

If you work in a shared project, and another user adds a scoped registry to the project, Unity warns you that another user added a new scoped registry.

When you select **Close**, the Package Manager project settings window appears so you can manage scoped registries for your project.

If you select **Read more**, Unity opens Scoped registries in your default web browser.

**Tip:** To access the Package Manager project settings window at any time, use the main menu in Unity (**Edit > Project Settings**, then the **Package Manager** category). You can also select **Advanced Project Settings** from the advanced settings menu in the Package Manager window.

## Authenticate with a scoped registry

If you want to access a scoped registry that requires authentication, you must configure your Package Manager user configuration file with npm authentication. For more information, refer to Scoped registry authentication.
