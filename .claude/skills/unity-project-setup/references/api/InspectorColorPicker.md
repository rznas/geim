# Select colors and color gradients

The ****Inspector**** window displays color properties as swatches. The swatch:

- Shows the current color.
- Shows the transparency as a slider under the color.
- Acts as a button to open the **Color** window.

## Color window types

The Unity Editor opens the type of **Color** window that matches the property you’re editing. The window can be one of three types:

- Single color: Used for most color properties.
- High Dynamic Range (HDR) color: For example, for the emission color in the standard shader. For more information, refer to the HDR color picker reference.
- Gradient: For example, for the color over lifetime in the Particle System.

## Select a color

To select a color, use the color wheel, the sliders or text fields, or the eyedropper tool.

### Pick a color from the color wheel

The color wheel represents the full color spectrum. To select a color, click anywhere on the circle.

The square at the center of the circle is a zoomed-in view of the color wheel. Use it to fine-tune the color you selected in the wheel.

To set the transparency (the Alpha value), use the **A** slider.

### Enter values or use the sliders

The sliders and entry fields in the color picker window let you enter color values in different formats:

- RGB `0-255`
- RGB `0-1.0`
- HSV

All three options have an alpha (**A**) slider for transparency.

You can enter exact values in the fields, or use the sliders to change the values.

Use the **Hexadecimal** field to enter a color value in hexadecimal format.

### Use an existing color with the eyedropper tool

To use an existing color, sample it with the eyedropper tool:

1. Click the eyedropper.
2. Click on a **pixel** to select its color. You can use any pixel, in or outside of the Unity Editor.

**Tip:** The eyedropper is also available in the **Inspector** window, so you can use it without opening the **Color** window.

### Return to the previous color

The **Color** window has two swatches. One shows the color before you edited it, and the other shows the current selection.

To reset your selection to the original color, click the original color swatch.

## Create swatch presets and libraries

You can save your color swatch selections as presets, and organize them into libraries.

### Save a swatch preset

In the **Swatches** section, the last swatch in the list is a representation of your current edit. To save the color as a preset:

1. Click the last swatch in the list.
2. Enter a name for the preset.

### Manage a swatch preset

To delete a preset, right-click it and select **Delete**.

To replace a preset, right-click it and select **Replace**. This saves your current color selection to the preset.

To rearrange the swatches, drag them to a new position in the list.

### Create and manage swatch libraries

You can save your swatch presets to one or more libraries, and move between your library and the default library. Use the **More** (⋮) menu to create and move between libraries.

## Use a gradient

A gradient moves from one color to another over time or space. The transition can be gradual, with the colors blending into each other, or as steps between color blocks.

The **Gradient Editor** is available only for properties that set up to use gradients rather than single colors. For example:

- The Particle System uses gradients to change **particle** color over their lifetime.
- The Line Renderer uses gradients to change the color of the line along its length.

You can’t change a single color property to a gradient property in the **Inspector** window, but you can use a script to override the property. For more information, refer to Gradient class.

## Use the Gradient Editor

To open the **Gradient Editor**, click the color swatch in the **Inspector** window.

The **Gradient Editor** controls both the colors and transparency of the gradient. The gradient bar shows the colors and how they blend, as determined by the interpolation mode. The color stops are upward-pointing markers, and the transparency stops are downward-pointing markers.

### Gradient types

Every gradient has both color and transparency settings. With these settings, you can create four types of gradients:

- Two or more colors with a transparency gradient.
- Two or more colors with a fixed transparency.
- A single color with a transparency gradient.
- A single color with a fixed transparency. Use this if you don’t want to change the color, but also don’t want to override the gradient property with a script.

### Select colors

A gradient has two color stops by default, but you can:

- Add stops for a more complex gradient.
- Set both stops to the same color to avoid blending between colors.

The color stops are upward-pointing markers along the bottom of the gradient bar. Click a stop to select it, or click under the bar to add a stop, and then:

- To change the color:
  - Select the color swatch to edit the color using a standard **Color** window. Note that the **Color** window for gradient stops doesn’t have an alpha slider, because the gradient itself handles transparency.
  - Use the eyedropper tool to sample a color value. Click the eyedropper button, then click anywhere on the screen. Unity sets the color property to the color of the pixel you clicked.
- To move the stop, drag it along the bar, or enter a new value in the **Location** field.
- To delete a stop, drag it out of the gradient bar.

Color interpolation happens only between the stops. To start or end a gradient with a solid color, move the first or last stop away from the gradient’s edge.

**Tip:** You can undo changes one by one, or you can save your start gradient as a preset before editing it.

### Set transparency

The transparency stops are downward-pointing markers along the top of the gradient bar. The stop’s color ranges from white to black to indicate the level of transparency.

The default gradient has two transparency stops set to 100% alpha, making the gradient fully opaque. You can:

- Edit a stop to adjust the transparency.
- Add stops to change the transparency at different points in the gradient.

You can edit and add transparency stops the same way you edit and add color stops. When you select a transparency stop, the color swatch changes to a transparency slider.

Transparency in the fixed mode isn’t interpolated between stops. It forms a block of fixed transparency to the left of each stop, and isn’t applied to the right of that stop. However, the transparency blocks don’t have to align with the color blocks within the gradient. You can change the transparency multiple times within a color block, or use a single transparency across multiple color blocks.

### Select an interpolation mode

A gradient can use one of three color interpolation modes:

- Classic blend: A linear interpolation between stops.
- Perceptual blend: A perceptually uniform [Oklab](https://bottosson.github.io/posts/oklab/) color space to interpolate between stops. This creates smoother transitions between colors, with smaller differences in brightness, when compared to the classic mode.
- Fixed: No interpolation between stops. This creates a set of color blocks. You can still change transparency within and between blocks.

The images show the three color modes. Note that the gradient in the classic mode has sharper transitions between colors than the perceptual mode.

### Create gradient presets and libraries

Presets save both the color values and the transparency values you’re using. Any preset you save is available in the **Gradient Editor** for any gradient property in your project.

The **Presets** section previews the gradient as the next preset on the list, and it changes as you edit. To save a preset from your current edit, click **New** on the preview preset.

To use a preset, click it. Any changes you make then create a new preset that you can save. To save your changes to the original preset, right-click the preset and select **Replace**.

**Tip:** You can create a preset from the default gradient, so you can always return to it.

You can save your presets to one or more libraries, and move between your library and the default library. Use the **More** (⋮) menu to create and move between libraries.
