# Unity scripting symbol reference

## Platform symbols

Unity automatically defines certain symbols based on the authoring and build target platform. These are as follows:

| **Define** | **Function** |
| --- | --- |
| `UNITY_EDITOR` | Scripting symbol to call Unity Editor **scripts** from your game code. |
| `UNITY_EDITOR_WIN` | Scripting symbol for Editor code on Windows. |
| `UNITY_EDITOR_OSX` | Scripting symbol for Editor code in macOS. |
| `UNITY_EDITOR_LINUX` | Scripting symbol for Editor code on Linux. |
| `UNITY_EMBEDDED_LINUX` | Scripting symbol for embedded Linux. |
| `UNITY_QNX` | Scripting symbol for QNX. |
| `UNITY_STANDALONE_OSX` | Scripting symbol to compile or execute code specifically for macOS (including Universal, PPC and Intel architectures). |
| `UNITY_STANDALONE_WIN` | Scripting symbol for compiling/executing code specifically for Windows standalone applications. |
| `UNITY_STANDALONE_LINUX` | Scripting symbol for compiling/executing code specifically for Linux standalone applications. |
| `UNITY_STANDALONE` | Scripting symbol for compiling/executing code for any standalone platform (Mac OS X, Windows or Linux). |
| `UNITY_SERVER` | Scripting symbol for compiling/executing code for a dedicated server (macOS, Windows or Linux). |
| `UNITY_IOS` | Scripting symbol for compiling/executing code for the iOS platform. |
| `UNITY_ANDROID` | Scripting symbol for the Android platform. |
| `UNITY_TVOS` | Scripting symbol for the Apple TV platform. |
| `UNITY_VISIONOS` | Scripting symbol for the VisionOS platform. |
| `UNITY_WSA` | Scripting symbol for Universal Windows Platform. |
| `UNITY_WSA_10_0` | Scripting symbol for Universal Windows Platform. |
| `UNITY_WEBGL` | Scripting symbol for Web. |
| `UNITY_ANALYTICS` | Scripting symbol for calling Unity **Analytics** methods from your game code. |
| `UNITY_ASSERTIONS` | Scripting symbol for assertions control process. |
| `UNITY_64` | Scripting symbol for 64-bit platforms. In practice this **should not be used** because it does not work on all 64-bit architectures and different CPU architectures on a given platform can share the same compiled assemblies. To execute code conditionally based on architecture, use a standard `if` statement that checks [IntPtr.Size](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.intptr.size?view=net-8.0), which is `4` in a 32-bit process and `8` in a 64-bit process. For an example, refer to Alternatives to directives. |

## Unity Editor version symbols

Unity automatically defines certain scripting symbols based on the version of the Unity Editor that you’re currently using.

Given a version number `X.Y.Z` (for example, 6000.0.33), Unity exposes three global scripting symbols in the following formats: `UNITY_X`, `UNITY_X_Y` and `UNITY_X_Y_Z`.

Here is an example of scripting symbols exposed in Unity 6000.0.33:

| **Define** | **Function** |
| --- | --- |
| `UNITY_6000` | Scripting symbol for the release version of Unity 6, exposed in every 6000.Y.Z release. |
| `UNITY_6000_0` | Scripting symbol for the major version of Unity 6.0, exposed in every 6000.0.Z release. |
| `UNITY_6000_0_33` | Scripting symbol for the minor version of Unity 6000.0.33. |

You can also compile code selectively based on the earliest version of Unity required to compile or execute a section of code snippet. Following the same version format describd previously (`X.Y`), Unity exposes one global `#define` in the format `UNITY_X_Y_OR_NEWER` (for example, `UNITY_6000_0_OR_NEWER`), that you can use for this purpose.

## Other symbols

The other symbols Unity defines are:

| **Define** | **Function** |
| --- | --- |
| `CSHARP_7_3_OR_NEWER` | Defined when building scripts with support for C# 7.3 or newer. |
| `ENABLE_MONO` | Scripting back end #define for Mono. |
| `ENABLE_IL2CPP` | Scripting back end #define for **IL2CPP**. |
| `ENABLE_VR` | Defined when the target build platform supports **VR**. Doesn’t imply that VR is currently enabled or that the necessary **plug-ins** and packages needed to support VR are installed. |
| `NET_2_0` | Defined when building scripts against .NET 2.0 API compatibility level on Mono and IL2CPP. |
| `NET_2_0_SUBSET` | Defined when building scripts against .NET 2.0 Subset API compatibility level on Mono and IL2CPP. |
| `NET_LEGACY` | Defined when building scripts against .NET 2.0 or .NET 2.0 Subset API compatibility level on Mono and IL2CPP. |
| `NET_4_6` | Defined when building scripts against .NET 4.x API compatibility level on Mono and IL2CPP. |
| `NET_STANDARD_2_0` | Defined when building scripts against .NET Standard 2.0 API compatibility level on Mono and IL2CPP. |
| `NET_STANDARD_2_1` | Defined when building scripts against .NET Standard 2.1 API compatibility level on Mono and IL2CPP. |
| `NET_STANDARD` | Defined when building scripts against .NET Standard 2.1 API compatibility level on Mono and IL2CPP. |
| `NETSTANDARD2_1` | Defined when building scripts against .NET Standard 2.1 API compatibility level on Mono and IL2CPP. |
| `NETSTANDARD` | Defined when building scripts against .NET Standard 2.1 API compatibility level on Mono and IL2CPP. |
| `ENABLE_WINMD_SUPPORT` | Defined when Windows Runtime support is enabled on IL2CPP. For more information, refer to WinRT API in C# scripts for UWP. |
| `ENABLE_INPUT_SYSTEM` | Defined when the Input System package is enabled in **Player Settings**. |
| `ENABLE_LEGACY_INPUT_MANAGER` | Defined when the legacy **Input Manager** is enabled in Player Settings. |
| `DEVELOPMENT_BUILD` | Defined when your script is running in a Player which was built with the **Development Build** option enabled.  This define only reflects whether the development build option was enabled at the time of the build. To know whether your script is running in the development build mode, use Debug.isDebugBuild. `DEVELOPMENT_BUILD` isn’t sufficient to determine whether you’re currently running in a development build because most platforms allow changing between development and non-development build without rebuilding the project. However, on some platforms, Unity doesn’t support switching between development and non-development builds in the Editor and requires you to switch after the build is complete. For example, on Windows, you can choose the **Create Visual Studio solution** option to choose whether you want a development or non-development build in Visual Studio. Switching in Visual Studio doesn’t recompile your scripts and therefore, it will not reevaluate scripting defines. You can also switch from the final game build to a development build by swapping `UnityPlayer.dll` in the game build with the one from a development build for debugging live game builds. |
| `UNITY_CLOUD_BUILD` | Defined when the project is built with [Unity Build Automation](https://docs.unity.com/ugs/en-us/manual/devops/manual/unity-build-automation). |

**Note**: The `DEBUG` symbol is predefined in C# and in Unity using the directive `#if DEBUG` is equivalent to `#if UNITY_EDITOR || DEVELOPMENT_BUILD`
