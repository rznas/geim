# Search the Unity Editor main menu

Use the Menus search provider to access the Unity Editor main menu commands.

## Query syntax

Provider token: `m:`

Query example: List all menu commands related to splines, from all submenus.

```
m: splines
```

## Provider filters

The Menus provider has additional filters in the visual query builder. This table lists the filters and their textual query equivalents.

| Filter | Search token | Query example | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Menu Path** | `m: id:<"path">` | `m: id:"2d/tiles"` | Searches only within the **2D** > **Tiles** menu. |

## Results

**Search** window tab: **Menus**.

## Actions

Default action: Executes the menu command.

Notes:

- For commands like **Create**, make sure you’re in the correct folder in the **Project** window before executing the command.
- For commands that interact with GameObjects in the **Hierarchy** window, make sure to select the correct **GameObject** in the **Hierarchy** window before executing the command, or the command might work at the **scene** level. For example, if you execute **Create Empty Child** while your focus is in the **Project** window, the Unity Editor creates the GameObject at the scene level rather than as a child of a GameObject.
- Some commands, like **Duplicate**, don’t execute from the **Search** window.
