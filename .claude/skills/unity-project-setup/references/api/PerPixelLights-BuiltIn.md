# Per-pixel and per-vertex lights in the Built-In Render Pipeline

If you use the default Forward rendering path, Unity sets each realtime Light component as one of the following types:

- Per-pixel light
- Per-vertex light
- Spherical harmonics (SH) per-vertex light

For more information, refer to Per-pixel and per-vertex lights.

The Built-In **Render Pipeline** renders each **GameObject** once for each per-pixel light that affects it.

SH lights are fast, and have little or no performance impact. However, SH lights don’t support cookies, **normal maps**, or specular highlights. They also have sharp lighting transitions, and might look incorrect.

## How Unity classifies lights

By default, Unity groups lights using the following criteria:

- The brightest light is always a per-pixel light. This is usually the main Directional Light.
- The 4 next most important lights are per-vertex lights.
- The remaining lights are SH lights.

During rendering, Unity finds all lights surrounding a **mesh** and calculates which of those lights affect it most.

For example, in the following image where a sphere GameObject is lit by 8 lights with the same color and intensity, Unity sets the four closest lights (A to D) as per-pixel lights, lights D to G to per-vertex lights, and lights G and H as SH lights. Each per-pixel light creates a separate render pass.

To help avoid visible light transitions when GameObjects and lights move, Unity blends lights from one mode to another. In the preceding example, Unity blends light D from a per-pixel light to a per-vertex light.

For information about optimizing how Unity classifies lights, refer to Optimize lighting in the Built-In Render Pipeline.
