# SpeedTree model import

[SpeedTree](https://store.speedtree.com) provides prebuilt tree Assets and modeling software focused specifically on trees.

Unity recognizes and imports SpeedTree Assets in the same way that it handles other Assets. If you’re using SpeedTree Modeler 7, make sure to resave your .spm files using the Unity version of the Modeler. If you’re using SpeedTree Modeler 8, 9, or 10, you can save your .st or .st9 files directly into the Unity Project folder.

Make sure that Textures are reachable in the Project folder and that Unity automatically generates Materials for each Level of Detail (LOD). When you select an Asset, there are import settings to tweak the generated **GameObject** and attached Materials. Unity does not re-generate Materials when you re-import them, unless you click the **Generate Materials** or **Apply & Generate Materials** button. Therefore, it is possible to preserve any customizations to the Materials.

The SpeedTree importer generates a **Prefab** with the LODGroup component configured. You can instantiate the Prefab in a **Scene** as a common Prefab instance, or select the Prefab as a tree prototype and paint it across the **Terrain**.

Additionally, the Terrain accepts any GameObject with an LODGroup component as a tree prototype, and does not place limitations on the **Mesh** size, or number of Materials used. This is different from Tree Editor trees. However, be aware that SpeedTree trees usually use three to four different Materials, which as a result, issues a number of draw calls every frame. Thus, we recommend that you avoid heavy use of **LOD** trees on platforms, such as the mobile platforms, where additional draw calls are relatively costly in terms of rendering performance.

## Materials

The SpeedTree Model Importer has a **Materials** tab to improve the workflow for handling SpeedTree Material Assets. See documentation on the SpeedTree Model Importer’s Material tab page for more information.

## Casting and receiving real-time shadows

To make billboards cast shadows correctly, Unity rotates billboards during the shadow caster pass to make them face the light direction (or light position in the case of point light) instead of facing the **camera**.

To enable these options, select the **Billboard** LOD level in the **Inspector** of a SpeedTree Asset, check **Cast Shadows** or **Receive Shadows** in **Billboard Options**, and click **Apply**.

To change the billboard shadow options of instantiated SpeedTree GameObjects, select the billboard GameObject in the **Hierarchy** window and tweak these options in the **Inspector** of the **Billboard Renderer**.

The trees you paint on a Terrain inherit billboard shadow options from the Prefab. Use `BillboardRenderer.shadowCastingMode` and `BillboardRenderer.receiveShadows` to alter these options at runtime.

**Known issues:** As with any other renderer, the **Receive Shadows** option has no effect while using deferred rendering. Billboards always receive shadows in deferred path.
