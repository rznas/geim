# Avatar Muscle & Settings tab reference

Unity’s animation system allows you to control the range of motion of different bones using **Muscles**.

Once the Avatar has been properly configured, the animation system “understands” the bone structure and allows you to start using the **Muscles & Settings** tab of the **Avatar**’s **Inspector**. Use the **Muscles & Settings** tab to tweak the character’s range of motion and ensure the character deforms in a convincing way, free from visual artifacts or self-overlaps.

The areas of the **Muscle & Settings** tab include:

**(A)** Buttons to toggle between the **Mapping** and **Muscles & Settings** tabs. You must **Apply** or **Revert** any changes made before switching between tabs.

**(B)** Use the **Muscle Group Preview** area to manipulate the character using predefined deformations. These affect several bones at once.

**(C)** Use the **Per-Muscle Settings** area to adjust individual bones in the body. You can expand the muscle settings to change the range limits of each settings. For example, by default, Unity gives the Head-Nod and Head-Tilt settings a possible range of –40 to 40 degrees but you can decrease these ranges even further to add stiffness to these movements.

**(D)** Use the **Additional Settings** to adjust specific effects in the body.

**(E)** The **Muscles** menu provides a **Reset** tool to return all muscle settings to their default values.

**(F)** Buttons to accept any changes made (**Accept**), discard any changes (**Revert**), and leave the Avatar window (**Done**). You must **Apply** or **Revert** any changes made before leaving the **Avatar** window.

## Previewing changes

For the settings in the **Muscle Group Preview** and **Per-Muscle Settings** areas, you can preview the changes right in the **Scene** view. You can drag the sliders left and right to see the range of movement for each setting applied to your character:

You can see the bones of the skeleton through the **Mesh**.

## Translate Degree of Freedom (DoF)

You can enable the **Translate DoF** option in the **Additional Settings** to enable translation animations for the humanoid. If this option is disabled, Unity animates the bones using only rotations. **Translation DoF** is available for Chest, UpperChest, Neck, LeftUpperLeg, RightUpperLeg, LeftShoulder and RightShoulder muscles.

**Note:** Enabling **Translate DoF** can increase performance requirements, because the animation system needs to perform an extra step to retarget **humanoid animation**. For this reason, you should only enable this option if you know your animation contains animated translations of some of the bones in your character.
