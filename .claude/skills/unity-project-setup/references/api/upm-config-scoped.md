# Scoped registry authentication

Some package providers and organizations host packages on private package registries that require authentication to access.

If you’re a consumer or an organization member trying to access a scoped registry that requires authentication, you must configure your Package Manager user configuration file with npm authentication.

To set this access up:

1. Fetch an npm authentication token.
2. Add that token to your user configuration file.

## 1) Fetch the npm authentication token

The process of creating and accessing an npm authentication token is different for each registry provider. For example, JFrog’s [Artifactory](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/JFrog+Artifactory) repository manager uses a different procedure to generate the authentication token from npm. This is an example of a typical procedure, but you need to follow the process recommended by the specific package registry provider for your scoped registry.

To fetch an authentication token from npm:

1. Install [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) locally on your computer.
2. From a terminal, enter the following command to log in to the registry, replacing `<registry url>` with the URL of the registry server: `$ npm login --registry <registry url>`
3. Locate and open the generated [.npmrc](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/npmrc) file.
4. Locate either the `_authToken` or the `_auth` entry and copy its value (refer to the example that follows). Depending on the registry, the token string can be a globally unique identifier (GUID), a token, or a proprietary-formatted string.

### Examples of .npmrc files

This is an example of an `.npmrc` file containing an `_authToken` attribute:

```
registry=https://example.com:1234/mylocation/
//example.com:1234/mylocation/:_authToken=<AUTH TOKEN>
```

This is an example of an `.npmrc` file containing an`_auth` attribute:

```
registry=https://example.com:1234/mylocation
_auth=<AUTH TOKEN>
email=<EMAIL>
always-auth=true
```

## 2) Configure authentication information

Store your token information for each scoped registry that requires authentication in the `.upmconfig.toml` user configuration file using the `npmAuth` configuration schema. After you save this information to the configuration file, Package Manager will provide your authentication information on every request made to each registry in the file.

Follow these instructions to add your authentication information to the user configuration file:

1. Locate the `.upmconfig.toml` user configuration file. If the file doesn’t exist, create an empty text file.
2. Format your authentication information using a schema, depending on whether you’re using a Bearer (token-based) or Basic (Base64-encrypted) authentication mechanism.

```
[npmAuth."<REGISTRY URL>"]
<TOKEN-PROPERTY> = "<TOKEN-VALUE>"
email = "<EMAIL>"
alwaysAuth = <BOOLEAN>
```

The information in the following table explains how to specify the configuration file values:

| **Entry** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| `[npmAuth."<REGISTRY-URL>"]` | Required. URL of the registry. For example, `[npmAuth."https://example.com:8081/mylocation"]`. |
| `<TOKEN-PROPERTY> = "<TOKEN-VALUE>"` | Required. The authentication token generated from the npm registry. This can be a GUID, a token, or a proprietary-formatted string. For example, this can be either `token = "<AUTH TOKEN>"` (Bearer) or `_auth = "<BASE64 TOKEN>"` (Basic). |
| **email** | Optional. Email address for the user matching the user’s email on the registry. |
| **alwaysAuth** | Optional. Set to `true` if the package metadata and tarballs aren’t located on the same server. Typically, you can copy the value from the .npmrc file you generated. |

#### Example using bearer authentication

```
[npmAuth."http://localhost:8081/myrepository/mylocation"]
token = "NpmToken.2348c7ea-6f86-3dbe-86b6-f257e86569a8"
alwaysAuth = true

[npmAuth."http://localhost:4873"]
token = "eaJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJyZWFsX2dyb3VwcyI6WyJwYXNjYWxsIl0sIm5hbWUiOiJwYXNjYWxsIiwiZ3JvdXBzIjpbIn"

[npmAuth."https://api.bintray.example/npm/mycompany/myregistry"]
token = "aGFzY2FsbDo4ZWIwNTM5NzBjNTI3OTIwYjQ4MDVkYzY2YWEzNmQxOTkyNDYzZjky"
email = "username@example.com"
alwaysAuth = true
```

### Configure basic authentication information

These steps use Azure DevOps as an example, but the process is similar for any platform that uses a personal access token (PAT).

Before you begin, install `Node.js` if it’s not already installed.

1. Get your Azure DevOps personal access token (PAT), and have it ready for a later step. If you need to regenerate your PAT, log in to Azure DevOps ([https://dev.azure.com](https://dev.azure.com)) and go to **User settings** > **Personal access tokens**. For information about using PATs, refer to the Microsoft article, [Use personal access tokens](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate).
2. From a command line, run the following command: `node -e "require('readline').createInterface({input:process.stdin,output:process.stdout,historySize:0}).question('Enter PAT> ',p => {b64=Buffer.from(p.trim()).toString('base64');console.log(b64);process.exit();})"`
3. At the `Enter PAT` prompt, type `email:PAT`, replacing:
  - `email` with the email associated with your Azure DevOps account and the email specified in the `.upmconfig.toml` file
  - `PAT` with your PAT from the earlier step
4. The command returns a Base64-encrypted string. Copy that string and assign it as the value for the `_auth` key in the `.upmconfig.toml` file.

#### Example using basic authentication

```
[npmAuth."http://localhost:8081/myrepository/mylocation"]
_auth = "c19kaW5pcm9AaG90bWFpbC4jb206d3FzdzVhemU9Q=="
email = "username@example.com"
alwaysAuth = true
```
