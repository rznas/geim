# Layer-based collision detection

Layer-based **collision** detection is a way to make a **GameObject** collide with another GameObject that’s set up on a specific layer or layers.

The Layer Collision Matrix defines which GameObjects can collide with which Layers. To open the Layer Collision Matrix go to **Edit > Project Settings > Physics**.

In the image, the Layer Collision Matrix is set up so that only GameObjects that belong to the same layer can collide:

- Layer 1 is checked for Layer 1 only
- Layer 2 is checked for Layer 2 only
- Layer 3 is checked for Layer 3 only

If, for example, you want Layer 1 to collide with Layer 2 and 3, but not with Layer 1, find the row for **Layer 1**, then check the boxes for the **Layer 2** and **Layer 3** columns, and leave the **Layer 1** column checkbox blank.

## Set up layer-based collision detection

1. Select the GameObject you want to assign a layer to.
2. In the **Inspector**, select the **Layer** dropdown at the top, and either choose a Layer or add a new Layer. Repeat for each GameObject until you have finished assigning your GameObjects to Layers.   Cube selected in the Inspector, with Layer 1 assigned to it.
3. In the Unity menu bar, go to **Edit** > **Project Settings**, then select the **Physics** category to open the Physics window.
4. Select the layers on the Collision Matrix that you want to interact with the other layers.
