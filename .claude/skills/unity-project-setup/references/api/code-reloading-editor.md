# Code and scene reload on entering Play mode

Authoring your application in Edit mode and then switching to Play mode to preview its runtime behavior is a core feature of iterative development in the Unity Editor. By default the Editor reloads both your code and **scene** assets as part of the transition from Edit mode to Play mode. It’s important to understand what Unity reloads, why and when it does so, and how you can configure the reloading behavior. This helps you make informed trade-offs between development iteration time and the degree to which Play mode accurately reflects your built application’s performance.
