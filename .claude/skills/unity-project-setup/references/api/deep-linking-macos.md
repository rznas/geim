# Deep linking for macOS

Deep links are hyperlinks that take a user to a specific location within an app rather than a website. When a user clicks a deep link, the application opens from the designated location, such as a specific **scene** in a Unity application. There are two ways to enable deep links for macOS applications: URL schemes and universal links.

For information on how to use deep links and handle them when your application opens, refer to Using deep links.

## URL schemes

A URL scheme specifies a link structure that your macOS application refers to. The device opens the application when the user clicks a deep link that matches the URL scheme structure. To add a URL scheme, use the following:

1. Go to **Edit** > **Project Settings** > **Player** > **Other Settings**.
2. In the Mac Configuration section, set the following properties:
  - **Size** property to `1`.
  - **Element 0** property to the URL scheme to use with your application. For example, use `unitydl` to open your application when the device processes a link that starts with `unitydl://`.

**Note**: To use multiple URL schemes in your project, increase the value of the **Size** property.

## Universal links

Universal links are similar to deep links because they open a specific location within an app. However, if the app isn’t installed, a universal link opens a URL in Safari. To enable universal links, refer to Apple’s documentation on [Allowing Apps and Websites to Link to Your Content](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/allowing-apps-and-websites-to-link-to-your-content).
