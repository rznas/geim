# Create a custom playable

This example demonstrates how to create a custom playable (`PlayQueuePlayable`) with the `PlayableBehaviour` public class. This example also demonstrate how to override the `PrepareFrame()` virtual method to control nodes on the `PlayableGraph`. You can use a custom playable to override other virtual methods in the `PlayableBehaviour` class.

In this example, the controlled nodes are a series of animation clips (`clipsToPlay`). The `SetInputWeight()` method modifies the blend weight of each animation clip to ensure that only one clip plays at a time. The `SetTime()` method adjusts the local time so playback starts when an animation clip is active.

## Prerequisites

To use the `CustomPlayableExample` script in your project, your project must have the following:

- A **GameObject**, such as a cube or a capsule. You don’t need to manually add an **Animator component** to this GameObject. The `RequireComponent` attribute adds this component if it’s not present.
- At least two animation clips that animate the properties of the GameObject. For example, at least two animation clips that change the position or rotation of a GameObject.

## Add and run the script

To use the `CustomPlayableExample` script in your project, follow these steps:

1. Add a script component to your GameObject. Name the script file `CustomPlayableExample.cs` and use the following code: `using UnityEngine; using UnityEngine.Animations; using UnityEngine.Playables; public class PlayQueuePlayable : PlayableBehaviour { private int m_CurrentClipIndex = -1; private float m_TimeToNextClip; private Playable mixer; public void Initialize(AnimationClip[] clipsToPlay, Playable owner, PlayableGraph graph) { owner.SetInputCount(1); mixer = AnimationMixerPlayable.Create(graph, clipsToPlay.Length); graph.Connect(mixer, 0, owner, 0); owner.SetInputWeight(0, 1); for (int clipIndex = 0 ; clipIndex < mixer.GetInputCount() ; ++clipIndex) { graph.Connect(AnimationClipPlayable.Create(graph, clipsToPlay[clipIndex]), 0, mixer, clipIndex); mixer.SetInputWeight(clipIndex, 1.0f); } } override public void PrepareFrame(Playable owner, FrameData info) { if (mixer.GetInputCount() == 0) return; // Advance to next clip if necessary. m_TimeToNextClip -= (float)info.deltaTime; if (m_TimeToNextClip <= 0.0f) { m_CurrentClipIndex++; if (m_CurrentClipIndex >= mixer.GetInputCount()) m_CurrentClipIndex = 0; var currentClip = (AnimationClipPlayable)mixer.GetInput(m_CurrentClipIndex); // Reset the time so that the next clip starts at the correct position. currentClip.SetTime(0); m_TimeToNextClip = currentClip.GetAnimationClip().length; } // Adjust the weight of the inputs. for (int clipIndex = 0 ; clipIndex < mixer.GetInputCount(); ++clipIndex) { if (clipIndex == m_CurrentClipIndex) mixer.SetInputWeight(clipIndex, 1.0f); else mixer.SetInputWeight(clipIndex, 0.0f); } } } [RequireComponent(typeof (Animator))] public class CustomPlayableExample : MonoBehaviour { public AnimationClip[] clipsToPlay; PlayableGraph graph; void Start() { graph = PlayableGraph.Create("CustomPlayableExample"); var queuePlayable = ScriptPlayable<PlayQueuePlayable>.Create(graph); var playQueue = queuePlayable.GetBehaviour(); playQueue.Initialize(clipsToPlay, queuePlayable, graph); var output = AnimationPlayableOutput.Create(graph, "Animation", GetComponent<Animator>()); output.SetSourcePlayable(queuePlayable, 0); // Play the graph graph.Play(); } void OnDisable() { // Destroy all Playables and Outputs created by the graph. graph.Destroy(); } }`
2. In the Script component, add at least two animation clips to the **Clips To Play** list.
3. Select **Play** to switch the Editor to Play mode. The `CustomPlayableExample` script cycles through the list of animation clips, adjusting the weight and time as each animation clip plays.
4. If you have installed the PlayableGraph Visualizer package, select `CustomPlayableExample` to display the PlayableGraph.
