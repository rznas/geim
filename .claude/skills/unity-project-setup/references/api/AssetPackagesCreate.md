# Create and export asset packages

To share any assets from your project’s `Assets` folder, you can export them as an **asset package** in the `.unitypackage` format. Asset packages are a convenient way to copy several assets or an entire **scene** from one project to another quickly, with little additional overhead.

If you want to distribute assets in a more formal way with long-term support, a defined structure, and semantic versioning, an alternative option is to create your own Unity package.

**Note**: If the assets in your asset package are high quality and other users might find them useful, refer to Publishing to the Asset Store for information on how to create a package draft and upload it to the **Asset Store**.

To create and export an asset package:

1. Open the project you want to export assets from.
2. Go to the **Project** window and select one or more items or folders. These items become the starting list for your export. You can also select the `Assets` folder to include all assets as your starting point.
3. Choose **Assets** > **Export Assets** from the menu to open the **Exporting package** dialog.
4. In the dialog, select the checkboxes for the assets you want to include in the package.
5. Enable the **Include dependencies** checkbox to automatically select any assets (including scripts) used by the assets you select.
6. Enable the **Include all **scripts**** checkbox to export all scripts from your project. If you disable **Include all scripts** but enable **Include dependencies**, Unity only exports scripts that your selected items directly depend on. Unity can’t trace the full chain of dependencies for your scripts, so enabling **Include all scripts** reduces the likelihood of compilation errors when using the exported package in another project.
7. Click **Export** to bring up the file explorer and choose where you want to store your package file.
8. Name and save the package.

## Re-exporting asset packages

To create a new version of your asset package with updated contents, perform the export procedure again and select the changed and unchanged files to include in the new version.

### Naming strategies

Name your updated package using incremental names suffixed with a version identifier, for example `MyAssetPackageVer1`, `MyAssetPackageVer2`, and so on. Unity recognizes these as updates of the same package. Use a naming convention that’s clear for you and anyone you share it with.

**Warning:** Don’t remove files from asset packages and then add different files with the same name. If you remove a file and later replace it, use a unique name for the replacement file. Attempting to reuse previously used file names can confuse Unity’s system for tracking assets and produce warnings on import. For more information, refer to Asset metadata.
