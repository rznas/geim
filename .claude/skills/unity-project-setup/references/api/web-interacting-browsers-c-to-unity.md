# Call C/C++/C# functions from Unity C# scripts

You can call functions from your C, C++, or C# **plug-ins** in your Unity projects.

Unity uses Emscripten to compile your sources into WebAssembly from C/C++/C# code, so you can write plug-ins in C/C++/C# code and call these functions from your Unity C# **scripts**.

To call functions from your JavaScript plug-ins instead, refer to Call JavaScript functions from Unity C# scripts.

## Import your C/C++/C# plug-in into your Unity project

To allow your Unity project to call functions from your C/C++/C# plug-in code, you need to import your plug-in into your Unity project.

Place your JavaScript plug-in files in any folder, such as `Assets/JSPlugins`.

## Example C++ code that you can use in Unity

If you use C++ (.cpp) to implement the plug-in, you must declare the functions with C linkage (`extern “C”`) to avoid name mangling issues. The following code is an example C++ plug-in with simple functions that you can call in your Unity project.

```
#include <stdio.h>

extern "C" void Hello ()
{
    printf("Hello, world!\n");
}

extern "C" int AddNumbers (int x, int y)
{
    return x + y;
}
```

**Note**: Unity uses the Emscripten version 2.0.19 toolchain.

Use the following Unity C# code in your Unity project to call the C++ functions.

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using System.Runtime.InteropServices;

public class NewBehaviourScript : MonoBehaviour {

    [DllImport("__Internal")]
    private static extern void Hello();

    [DllImport("__Internal")]
    private static extern int AddNumbers(int x, int y);

    void Start() {
        Hello();
        
        int result = AddNumbers(5, 7);
        Debug.Log(result);  
    }
}
```
