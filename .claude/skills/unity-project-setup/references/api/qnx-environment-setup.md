# Set up your environment for QNX

Set up your environment to develop with QNX.

To create a Unity application for QNX, you first need to set up your Unity project to support QNX. To support QNX, a Unity project requires certain environment variables and dependencies.

**Note**: You must install the QNX platform package before you can set up your environment. For more information, refer to Install the platform package for QNX.

## Set the environment variables

After you have installed the Unity Editor, you will need to set the environment variables. Open a terminal window and run one of the following commands to set the environment variables in the local shell and start the Editor from there.

- `qnxsdp-env.bat` (Windows)
- `source path/qnxsdp-env.sh` (Linux and macOS)

Alternatively, you can set the environment variables `QNX_TARGET` and `QNX_HOST` either locally in a terminal or globally, and then run the Editor.

These are the environment variables you need to set:

- `QNX_TARGET=/path/to/target/qnx`
- `QNX_HOST=/path/to/host/platform/arch`
- Add to `PATH:` `$QNX_HOST/usr/bin` (for QNX 7.1 only)

## Dependencies

QNX must provide direct and **indirect dependencies** so Unity can run correctly.

### Direct dependencies

Direct dependencies load at the application startup. Use the following dependencies for all versions of QNX:

- `libm.so.3`
- `libgcc_s.so.1`
- `libscreen.so.1`

Then, add dependencies specific to your version of QNX:

| **QNX version** | **Supported dependencies** |
| --- | --- |
| **QNX 7.1** | `libc.so.5`  `libsocket.so.3` (also known as `io-pkt`) `libasound.so.3` |
| **QNX 8.0** | `libc.so.6`  `libsocket.so.4` (also known as `io-sock`) |

**Note**: QNX 8.0 has no sound support so doesn’t need the `libasound` dependency.

### Indirect dependencies

Indirect dependencies load when needed during the application runtime, as a shared library.

| **Type** | **Dependencies** |
| --- | --- |
| **Webcam** | `libcamapi.so` (for QNX 7.1 only; QNX 8.0 has no camera support.) |
| **OpenGL ES** | `libEGL.so.1`, `libGLESv2.so.1` |
| **Devices** | `libudev.so.1` |

## Troubleshooting

If you notice one of the following issues in the **Build Profiles** window, then the QNX SDP Environment isn’t set up correctly:

- **Unable to find QNX_TARGET in Environment.**
- **The build environment does not fit the selected QNX Version.**
- **The build environment does not contain the selected QNX Architecture.**

Before starting the Editor, always check that you have the QNX SDP Environment set up correctly for the Editor to register it. For more information, refer to [QNX Software Center](https://www.qnx.com/download/group.html?programid=29178).
