# Create a Video Player component

Create a Video Player component to play videos in your **scene**.

There are a few ways to create a Video Player component in Unity. Choose from one of the following methods:

- Create a Video Player from the menu or hierarchy
- Add the component to an existing GameObject
- Drag a video clip into the scene
- Use C# scripting to add the component at runtime

After you set up your component, you can configure the settings to your liking. For information about the settings, refer to Video Player component reference.

## Create a Video Player from the menu or hierarchy

To create the Video Player component from the menu, select **GameObject** > **Video** > **Video Player**.

Alternatively, in the **Hierarchy**, select the **Add (+)** button and then select **Video** > **Video Player**.

Either method creates a new **GameObject** with a Video Player component attached.

## Add the component to an existing GameObject

You can also add a Video Player component to an existing GameObject. To do this, either drag a video file onto the GameObject, or:

1. Click on the GameObject.
2. In the **Inspector** window, select **Add Component**.
3. Select **Video** > **Video Player**.

As a result, your GameObject contains a Video Player component.

## Drag a video clip into the scene

The quickest way to create a Video Player component is to drag your video clip into the scene:

1. Locate the video file in your `Asset` folder in Unity.
2. Click and drag your file into an empty spot in the Scene Hierarchy, in the **Scene view**, or in the Inspector.

As a result, Unity creates a GameObject that contains a Video Player component and automatically assigns your video clip to the component.

## Use C# scripting to add the component at runtime

You can also use scripting to add a VideoPlayer component to a GameObject and configure its settings using C# **scripts**. Here’s an example code snippet:

```
// Add a Video Player component to the GameObject.
    VideoPlayer videoPlayer = gameObject.AddComponent<VideoPlayer>();
```

This code dynamically adds a Video Player component to the GameObject that contains this script at runtime.

You can then use the `videoPlayer` variable to access and modify the Video Player’s properties.
