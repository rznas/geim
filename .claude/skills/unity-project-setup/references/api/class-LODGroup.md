# LOD Group component reference

The **LOD Group** component lets you manage level of detail (LOD) for **GameObjects**.

| **Property** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Fade Mode** | Selects the transition effect type to apply between LOD levels. The options are the following:  **None**: Switches to the next LOD without a smooth transition.  **Cross Fade**: Applies a cross-fading effect to the model between the current and the next LOD.  **Speed Tree**: Interpolates the vertex positions of a SpeedTree model between the current and the next LOD. Applies only to SpeedTree models with .spm and .st extensions. For more information, refer to Make LOD transitions smooth in LOD Group. |
| **Animate Cross-fading** | Sets a single transition time for all LODs, which occurs after the LOD threshold is reached. This property is available only if you set **Fade Mode** to **Cross Fade** or **Speed Tree**. For more information, refer to Make LOD transitions smooth in LOD Group. |
| **LOD Group selection bar** | Displays the LOD levels as colored boxes. For more information, refer to the LOD Group selection bar section. |
| **Recalculate Bounds** | Recalculates the **bounding volume** that encompasses all LODs. Use this after you modify a LOD, for example if you adjust the **Scale** of the **Transform** component of a LOD renderer. |
| **Recalculate **Lightmap** Scale** | Updates the Scale in Lightmap property on all **Mesh** Renderers in the LOD Group, based on any changes to the LOD level boundaries. |
| **Object Size** | Sets the size of the object in meters for LOD Group calculations. For example, if you change **Object Size** from 1 to 0.6, an object that has a screen height of 100% is now considered to have a screen height of 60%. As a result, the transitions to smaller screen height percentages and less detailed LOD levels occur closer to the **camera**. |
| **Reset Object Size** | Resets **Object Size** to its default of 1, but recalculates LOD level boundaries so the transition distances in meters stay the same. |

## LOD Group selection bar

The LOD Group selection bar displays the LOD levels as colored boxes.

LOD level box. Displays a percentage of the screen height. The LOD level is active between this height and the height in the next LOD level box. For example, 50% means the LOD level becomes active when the object fills half the height of the camera view.

When you drag the camera icon, the **Scene** view displays the LOD level the camera renders at that ratio. The rectangle around the object is the bounding box of the object.

**Note:** Unity only displays the LOD label in the **Scene view** when a single GameObject is selected.

LOD level boundary. To change when the LOD level becomes active, select and drag the boundary.

**Note:** To preview LODs without the rest of the Scene view turning gray, from the main menu go to **Preferences** > **Scene View** and disable **Enable Filtering While Editing LOD Groups**.

## Renderers panel

To display the **Renderers** panel, select a LOD level box in the LOD Group selection bar.

| **Property** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Transition (% Screen Size)** | Sets the height of the object when the LOD level transitions to the next LOD level, as a percentage of the screen height.  To the right of this property, Unity displays the camera distance at which the LOD level transitions, in meters. |
| **Set to Camera** | Sets the **Transition (% Screen Size)** value to the height of the object in the current camera view. |
| **Fade Transition Width** | Sets the transition width between this LOD level and the next. A smaller value delays the beginning of the transition and makes the transition shorter. For example, if you set the **Fade Transition Width** of LOD0 to 0.4, the transition to LOD1 occurs over 40% of the LOD0 range. This property is only available if you set **Fade Mode** to **Cross Fade** and disable **Animate Cross-fading**.  For more information, refer to Make LOD transitions smooth in LOD Group. |
| **Renderers** | The Renderers to render at this LOD level. To add Renderers, select the **Add** (**+**) button, then select the Renderer picker (**⊙**) or drag and drop to add the GameObject that contains the Renderers.  For more information, refer to Import or create LOD levels for a LOD Group. |
