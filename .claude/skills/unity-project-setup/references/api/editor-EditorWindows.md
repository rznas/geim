# Create custom Editor Windows with IMGUI

**Note**: It’s strongly recommended to use the UI Toolkit to extend the Unity Editor, as it provides a more modern, flexible, and scalable solution than IMGUI.

You can create any number of custom windows in your app. These behave just like the **Inspector**, **Scene** or any other built-in ones. This is a great way to add a user interface to a sub-system for your game.

Making a custom Editor Window involves the following simple steps:

- Create a script that derives from EditorWindow.
- Use code to trigger the window to display itself.
- Implement the GUI code for your tool.

### Derive From EditorWindow

In order to make your Editor Window, your script must be stored inside a folder called “Editor”. Make a class in this script that derives from EditorWindow. Then write your GUI controls in the inner OnGUI function.

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEditor;
using System.Collections;

public class Example : EditorWindow

    {
        void OnGUI () {
            // The actual window code goes here
           }
    }
```

*MyWindow.cs - placed in a folder called ‘Editor’ within your project.*

### Showing the window

In order to show the window on screen, make a menu item that displays it. This is done by creating a function which is activated by the **MenuItem** property.

The default behavior in Unity is to recycle windows, so selecting the menu item again would show existing windows. This is done by using the function EditorWindow.GetWindow Like this:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEditor;
using System.Collections;

class MyWindow : EditorWindow {
    [MenuItem ("Window/My Window")]

    public static void  ShowWindow () {
        EditorWindow.GetWindow(typeof(MyWindow));
    }
    
    void OnGUI () {
        // The actual window code goes here
    }
}
```

*Showing the MyWindow*

This will create a standard, dockable editor window that saves its position between invocations, can be used in custom layouts, etc. To have more control over what gets created, you can use GetWindowWithRect

### Implementing Your Window’s GUI

The actual contents of the window are rendered by implementing the OnGUI function. You can use the same UnityGUI classes you use for your ingame GUI (**GUI** and **GUILayout**). In addition we provide some additional GUI controls, located in the editor-only classes **EditorGUI** and **EditorGUILayout**. These classes add to the controls already available in the normal classes, so you can mix and match at will.

The following C# code shows how you can add GUI elements to your custom EditorWindow:

```csharp
using UnityEditor;
using UnityEngine;

public class MyWindow : EditorWindow
{
    string myString = "Hello World";
    bool groupEnabled;
    bool myBool = true;
    float myFloat = 1.23f;
    
    // Add menu item named "My Window" to the Window menu
    [MenuItem("Window/My Window")]
    public static void ShowWindow()
    {
        //Show existing window instance. If one doesn't exist, make one.
        EditorWindow.GetWindow(typeof(MyWindow));
    }
    
    void OnGUI()
    {
        GUILayout.Label ("Base Settings", EditorStyles.boldLabel);
        myString = EditorGUILayout.TextField ("Text Field", myString);
        
        groupEnabled = EditorGUILayout.BeginToggleGroup ("Optional Settings", groupEnabled);
            myBool = EditorGUILayout.Toggle ("Toggle", myBool);
            myFloat = EditorGUILayout.Slider ("Slider", myFloat, -3, 3);
        EditorGUILayout.EndToggleGroup ();
    }
}
```

This example results in a window which looks like this:
