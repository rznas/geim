# BlendOp command in ShaderLab reference

Specifies the blending operation used by the Blend command. For this command to have any effect, there must also be a Blend command in the same Pass block (if this command is in a Pass block) or SubShader block (if this command is in a SubShader block).

Not all blending operations are supported on all devices, and support depends on both the graphics API and the hardware. Different graphics APIs handle unsupported blending operations differently: GL skips unsupported operations, and Vulkan and Metal fall back to Add operations.

## Render pipeline compatibility

| **Feature name** | **Universal **Render Pipeline** (URP)** | **High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP)** | **Custom SRP** | **Built-in Render Pipeline** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **BlendOp** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |

## Syntax

This command makes a change to the render state. Use it in a `Pass` block to set the render state for that Pass, or use it in a `SubShader` block to set the render state for all Passes in that SubShader.

| **Signature** | **Example syntax** | **Function** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `BlendOp <operation>` | `BlendOp Sub` | Sets the blending operation used by the Blend command. |

## Parameters

| **Parameter** | **Value** | **Function** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **operation** | `Add` | Add source and destination together. |
|  | `Sub` | Subtract destination from source. |
|  | `RevSub` | Subtract source from destination. |
|  | `Min` | Use the smaller of source and destination. |
|  | `Max` | Use the larger of source and destination. |
|  | `LogicalClear` | Logical operation: `Clear (0)` (1) |
|  | `LogicalSet` | Logical operation: `Set (1)` (1) |
|  | `LogicalCopy` | Logical operation: `Copy (s)` (1) |
|  | `LogicalCopyInverted` | Logical operation: `Copy inverted (!s)` 2 |
|  | `LogicalNoop` | Logical operation: `Noop (d)` (1) |
|  | `LogicalInvert` | Logical operation: `Invert (!d)` (1) |
|  | `LogicalAnd` | Logical operation: `And (s & d)` (1) |
|  | `LogicalNand` | Logical operation: `Nand !(s & d)` (1) |
|  | `LogicalOr` | Logical operation: `Or (s | d)` (1) |
|  | `LogicalNor` | Logical operation: `Nor !(s | d)` (1) |
|  | `LogicalXor` | Logical operation: `Xor (s ^ d)` (1) |
|  | `LogicalEquiv` | Logical operation: `Equivalence !(s ^ d)` (1) |
|  | `LogicalAndReverse` | Logical operation: `Reverse And (s & !d)` (1) |
|  | `LogicalAndInverted` | Logical operation: `Inverted And (!s & d)` (1) |
|  | `LogicalOrReverse` | Logical operation: `Reverse Or (s | !d)` (1) |
|  | `LogicalOrInverted` | Logical operation: `Inverted Or (!s | d)` (1) |
|  | `Multiply` | Advanced OpenGL blending operation: `Multiply` (2) |
|  | `Screen` | Advanced OpenGL blending operation: `Screen` (2) |
|  | `Overlay` | Advanced OpenGL blending operation: `Overlay` (2) |
|  | `Darken` | Advanced OpenGL blending operation: `Darken` (2) |
|  | `Lighten` | Advanced OpenGL blending operation: `Lighten` (2) |
|  | `ColorDodge` | Advanced OpenGL blending operation: `ColorDodge` (2) |
|  | `ColorBurn` | Advanced OpenGL blending operation: `ColorBurn` (2) |
|  | `HardLight` | Advanced OpenGL blending operation: `HardLight` (2) |
|  | `SoftLight` | Advanced OpenGL blending operation: `SoftLight` (2) |
|  | `Difference` | Advanced OpenGL blending operation: `Difference` (2) |
|  | `Exclusion` | Advanced OpenGL blending operation: `Exclusion` (2) |
|  | `HSLHue` | Advanced OpenGL blending operation: `HSLHue` (2) |
|  | `HSLSaturation` | Advanced OpenGL blending operation: `HSLSaturation` (2) |
|  | `HSLColor` | Advanced OpenGL blending operation: `HSLColor` (2) |
|  | `HSLLuminosity` | Advanced OpenGL blending operation: `HSLLuminosity` (2) |

Notes:

1. Logical operations require DX 11.1+ or Vulkan.
2. Advanced OpenGL blending operations require `GLES3.1 AEP+`, `GL_KHR_blend_equation_advanced`, or `GL_NV_blend_equation_advanced`. They can only be used with standard RGBA blending; they are not compatible with separate RGB and alpha blending.

## Examples

```
Shader "Examples/CommandExample"
{
    SubShader
    {
         // The rest of the code that defines the SubShader goes here.

        Pass
        {    
             // Enable subtractive blending for this Pass
             Blend SrcAlpha One
             BlendOp RevSub
            
              // The rest of the code that defines the Pass goes here.
        }
    }
}
```

This example code demonstrates the syntax for using this command in a SubShader block.

```
Shader "Examples/CommandExample"
{
    SubShader
    {
         // Enable subtractive blending for this SubShader
         Blend SrcAlpha One
         BlendOp RevSub

         // The rest of the code that defines the SubShader goes here.        

        Pass
        {    
              // The rest of the code that defines the Pass goes here.
        }
    }
}
```
