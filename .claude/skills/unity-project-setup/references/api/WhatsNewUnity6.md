- Added new controls such as the ToggleButtonGroup, Tab, and TabViews, and made improvements to existing controls.
- Added icon support to the Button, ListView, and TreeView controls.
- Added new UxmlElement and UxmlAttribute attributes. These attributes replace the existing UxmlFactory and UxmlTraits when you create custom controls. This streamlines the creation of custom controls, offering an efficient alternative through C# attributes, and eliminating the need for extensive code writing. For more information, refer to Migrate custom controls from an earlier version. Additionally, you can now create custom property drawers for fields in the same manner as the **Inspector**.
- Enhanced UI Builder with improvements to display what drives style properties, refined canvas manipulation, and made other enhancements. The updated UI Builder now also supports the authoring of UXML Objects, enabling the editing of the MultiColumnTreeView and MultiColumnListView.

Removed dependency on Legacy Text stack for IMGUI so that IMGUI now renders and calculates its metrics using TextCore. Some members from TextEditor have been deprecated to accommodate for the new TextUtilities used by both IMGUI and UITK. Their meanings are the same but their names have changed (from field to property):

- `TextEditor.multiline` is now `TextEditor.isMultiline`.
- `TextEditor.hasHorizontalCursorPos` is now `TextEditor.hasHorizontalCursor`.
- `TextEditor.revealCursor` is now `TextEditor.showCursor`.

### TextMeshPro

- Added support on Windows for Automatic proxy configuration. With this feature, you can use Unity applications seamlessly in a web proxy environment, with minimal configuration.
- If you use Unity on a Windows computer that lacks elevated privileges, you can enable the installation of Unity Editors by standard users.

## Entities

### Changes introduced in Unity 6.0 Preview

- Added serialization support for `UnityObjectRef<>` to enable unmanaged references to Unity assets. For example, instead of a Texture on a managed IComponentData, you can have a `UnityObjectRef<Texture>` on an unmanaged `IComponentData`.
- The Create menu adds the following Type templates:
  - `IComponentData`
  - `ISystem`
  - `IJobEntity`
  - Baker
- Changed the way that entities are stored in preparation for the consolidation of entities and GameObject workflows. Entity IDs are now globally unique and you can now move them efficiently from one entities world to another. This does not impact ECS workflows in Unity 6.0, but it does disambiguate debugging by always showing exact entities.
- Applied the following fixes to the entities Hierarchy window:
  - You can select entities and systems within the hierarchy.
  - Fixed an invalid range check that failed after you removed entities from the hierarchy view in valid use cases.
  - Stopped the entities hierarchy from throwing exceptions when entities are destroyed.
  - The entities hierarchy now removes all nodes of a scene and subscenes when the scene is unloaded.
  - An exception is no longer thrown when you enter a **prefab** from the entities hierarchy.
- Improved the performance of baking and the creation of archetypes and entity queries in worlds with a large number of existing types.
- Improved the performance of LocalToWorld systems and non-dirty hierarchies.
- Fixed an issue where an `EntityQuery` using `WithNone<T>` on an enable component wasn’t inserting a necessary job dependency.
- `EntityQuery` singleton methods now correctly handle cases where the query contains enableable components.
- Fixed memory leak issues, like ones affecting world deserialization and content delivery.
- Fixed breakpoints in jobs defined in systems with `System.API`.

## Graphics

### Changes introduced in Unity 6.0

Moved Unity 6.0 documentation for the Universal **Render Pipeline** (URP) to the Unity Engine manual. For example, documentation about lighting in URP is now in the Lighting section of the manual.

### Changes introduced in Unity 6.0 Preview

- Added support for indirect Dispatch Rays (part of DXR 1.1). The method is similar to `RayTracingShader.Dispatch`, but the three dispatch dimensions are retrieved from a GraphicsBuffer. Added `RayTracingShader.DispatchIndirect` and a new `CommandBuffer.DispatchRays` signature. Added `SystemInfo.supportsIndirectDispatchRays` capability status.
- Added the GPU Resident Drawer, which automatically uses the `BatchRendererGroup` API to draw GameObjects with GPU instancing. This reduces the number of draw calls and frees CPU processing time.
- Added support for SpeedTree GameObjects to the GPU Resident Drawer.
- Added support for GPU occlusion culling of instances if they’re compatible with the GPU Resident Drawer, including culling of small meshes.
- Adding a new per-batch layer filtering setting for the `BatchRendererGroup` API. You can use this setting to cull specific batches.
- Optimized CPU performance of the Volume framework in URP and HDRP, to improve efficiency on low-end hardware and allow more precise control over quality settings.
- Added a **Force No Crunch** texture compression setting in **Build Profiles** > **Asset Import Overrides**, which forces all textures to disable crunch compression and re-import.
- Added an `IRenderPipelineResources` interface that allows you to add new settings groups in the Graphics Settings window. Updated the default `IRenderPipelineGraphicsSettings` Inspector to trigger notifications when a value in Graphics Settings is modified, and added a custom menu in `IRenderPipelineGraphicsSettings`.
- Added UI Toolkit support for `CustomPostProcessOrder`.
- Added the option to cache render graph system compilation for both URP and HDRP.

### Changes introduced in 2023.2

- Unity 2023.2 introduces optimizations to SkinnedMeshRenderers across all supported platforms. These optimizations aim to batch compute **skinning** and blendshape dispatches. This can increase the amount of vertices deformed in parallel and improve the GPU performance of character and skinned mesh rendering.
- The Progressive GPU **Lightmapper** is now out of preview and fully supported. For more information, refer to Select the CPU or GPU for baking.
- Added APIs to move Light Probe positions at runtime.
- Removed the **Auto Generate** setting in the Lighting window. Related APIs are now obsolete. To check **lightmaps** while you’re editing, you can now select a Debug Draw Mode and set **Lighting Data** to **Preview**. This displays a preview of the baked lighting. The preview lightmaps are non-destructive, and you can use them after you’ve baked the scene.
- Added `BatchCullingContext.cullingFlags` to specify whether to cull lightmapped shadow casters.
- Added `rendererPriority` support for `BatchRendererGroup`.
- Added support for building **ray tracing** acceleration structures asynchronously on a compute queue. AsyncCompute CommandBuffers can now run `CommandBuffer.BuildRayTracingAccelerationStructure` commands. Added support for `RayTracingAccelerationStructure` to RenderGraph and Render Graph Viewer.
- Enabled exposing raytracing acceleration structure build flags for balancing build times versus ray tracing speed and memory consumption on the GPU. You can customize flags from C# when creating and building a `RayTracingAccelerationStructure`, or via the Renderer settings.
- Added mipmap limit support and mipmap stripping support for Texture2DArrays.
- Added support for providing tiled EXR images to LoadImage.
- Added Native Render Pass support for DX12.
- Added support for GPU batched skinning for D3D12 (Windows and XBox platforms).
- Added the Custom Vertex Streams feature for particle trails.
- Added `BakeTexture` and `BakeTrailsTexture` scripting methods.

### Changes introduced in 2023.1

- Introduced a new graphics jobs threading mode called **Split Graphics Jobs** to reduce unnecessary start and end of frame synchronization between the main and native graphics job threads.
- Introduced the new LightBaker v1.0 backend for manual lighting bakes, which makes baking more predictable and stable. Manual bakes no longer restart if you change the scene during baking, so the Editor is more responsive during baking. If you bake with the GPU backend, you can use a Baking Profile to select the tradeoff between performance and GPU memory usage.
- Added screen space lens flares that you can generate from all lights visible on the screen (direct, indirect, emissive surfaces, specular highlights) in just a few clicks with a single **post-processing** volume. These lens flares are compatible with both HDRP and URP. This feature complements the Lens Flare (SRP) component, which gives you more advanced artistic control over lens flares from lights, but which you can only use on predefined light sources (directional, point and spot lights), and can only manually associate with each one.
- Dynamic shader variant loading provides additional user control over shader loading behavior and memory usage. This optimization enables the streaming of shader data chunks into memory, and eviction of shader data that is no longer needed at runtime, based on a user controlled memory budget. This allows to significantly reduce shader memory usage on platforms with limited memory budgets.
- Added asynchronous compilation of pipeline state objects for shader warmup.
- Added DirectX Raytracing (DXR) 1.1 support in compute shaders. Added the following APIs: `SystemInfo.supportsInlineRayTracing`, `SystemInfo.supportsRayTracingShaders`, `ComputeShader.SetRayTracingAccelerationStructure`, and `CommandBuffer.SetRayTracingAccelerationStructure`(ComputeShader, …).
- Added `#pragma require inlineraytracing` to compute shaders.
- Added new `RayTracingAccelerationStructure.AddInstance` signature that allows adding mesh instances to the acceleration structure for GPU ray tracing. This is the equivalent of `Graphics.RenderMesh` from the **rasterization** pipeline.
- Added foveated rendering support for D3D12/Vulkan.
- Added foveated rendering support for Metal.
- Added support for loading EXR data through `ImageConversion.LoadImage()`.
- Added support for VK_EXT_debug_utils on Vulkan platforms.
- Added mipmap limit groups, for more fine-grained configurability over the single value that applies to all mipmapped Texture2D assets. For more information, refer to Quality settings.
- Enabled Ray Tracing Support in Terrain settings by default for new Terrains.
- Implemented `ScriptableRenderContext.CullShadowCasters` API to kick theBatchRendererGroup culling jobs earlier in URP and HDRP.
- Added standardized shader variant keywords for native 16-bit shader types, and wave operations. For more information, refer to Set a shader to require a shader model or GPU feature.
- Added a debug view to visualize probe sampling in Adaptive Probe Volumes. For more information, refer to Display Adaptive Probe Volumes.
- Merged the Adaptive Probe Volume window with the Lighting window.

### URP

For a complete description of new features and improvements in URP, refer to What’s new in URP.

#### Changes introduced in Unity 6.0 Preview

- Added the 8192x8192 option to Shadow texture resolution for the Main Light and Additional Lights.
- Added the camera history API which lets you access per-camera history textures and use them in custom render passes. History textures are the color and depth textures that Unity rendered for each camera in previous frames.
- Added Adaptive Probe Volumes (APV) Lighting Scenario Blending to URP.
- Added a new config package that lets you override the maximum number of visible lights.
- Added the Render Graph Viewer window. This tool lets you visualize how render passes use frame resources, and debug the rendering process.
- The Rendering Debugger now contains a Mipmap Streaming section. This section lets you inspect the texture streaming activity.
- Added C# script templates to create custom post-processing effects that use a volume component.
- Added APV sky occlusion support for URP.
- Added support for Spatial Temporal Post-Processing (STP) upscaling.
- The new render graph system improves the way you customize and maintain the render pipeline. The system reduces the amount of memory URP uses and makes memory management more efficient.
- This URP version implements the Alpha Processing setting. If you enable this setting, URP renders the post-processing output into a **render texture** with an alpha channel. In previous versions, URP discarded the alpha channel by replacing alpha values with 1.

#### Changes introduced in 2023.2

- Added cross-platform **HDR** display support. The Editor and built Players now provide full HDR tone mapping and display support, across all rendering pipelines and platforms that support HDR, including mobile and XR.
- Added per-vertex quality levels for indirect lighting from Probe Volumes so that URP renders lit environments more efficiently. On mobile platforms URP doesn’t support Lighting Scenario blending or Lighting Normalization for **Reflection Probes**.
- Added the **Camera And Objects** option in the Motion Blur volume component. The option uses motion vectors to blur objects that move faster than the camera’s exposure time.
- Added support for additional directional light cookies.
- Added the **Default Volume Profile** field to URP Global Settings.
- Added the **Volume Profile** field to the Universal Render Pipeline Asset.
- Added alembic velocity motion vector support for URP materials.

- Added support for foveated rendering in the Forward+ rendering path.

#### Changes introduced in 2023.1

- Added temporal anti-aliasing (TAA) support. The feature is not compatible with MSAA, **Dynamic Resolution**, or Camera stacking. The feature supports only fixed resolution, and does not support temporal upsampling.
- Added support for High Dynamic Range (HDR) output.
- Added the Detailed Stats section to URP Rendering Debugger.
- Ported all URP passes to use the RasterCommandBuffer API.
- Added the **AO Method** property to **SSAO** settings where you can select the options Interleaved Gradient Noise or Blue Noise.
- Added the **Blur Quality** property to **SSAO** settings where you can select the options High (Bilateral), Medium (Gaussian), or Low (Single-Pass Kawase).
- Added the Falloff field to SSAO settings to control the distance from the camera where the AO effect is applied.
- Added the clustered reflection probe support to the URP Forward+ rendering path. This enables the use of more than two reflection probes per object, allows Unity to skip per-object culling of lights and reflection probes, and enables Entities Graphics and procedural draws to make use of reflection probes.
- Added the low-code Custom Post Processing feature in URP.
- Added Decal support to render graph API.
- Added render graph API support to URP post-processing effects.
- Added support for shadow rendering to **2D objects**, such as sprites, **colliders**, sprite shape, and 2D animation.
- Added soft shadow rendering to shadow-casting 2D lights.
- Added a limited support of Probe Volumes, with no interpolation of lighting data sets, and limited performance on lower-end hardware.
- Improved FXAA quality. The new implementation provides better edge anti-aliasing (removing odd edge artifacts seen with the previous implementation) and better retention of texture quality. The improvement does not affect performance. The output quality is now comparable to the low and medium SMAA presets but with better performance.

### HDRP

For a complete description of new features and improvements in URP, refer to What’s new in HDRP.

#### Changes introduced in Unity 6.0 Preview

- Added support for overriding material properties such as smoothness, albedo, and **normal maps** on all materials to facilitate material and lighting debugging. The material override feature in HDRP is available through the Rendering Debugger’s Lighting panel when rendering through the path tracer pipeline.
- Added the Sky Occlusion feature to Adaptive Probe Volumes (APV), to allow time of day with static probe volumes.
- Disabled storing of baked data as Streaming Asset in Adaptive Probe Volumes (APV) to make it compatible with Asset Bundles and Addressables.
- Added AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 2 (FSR2) Unity script bindings and HDRP integration.
- Improved on existing Mipmap Streaming debug views and added more. The current offering in HDRP is consistent with what URP offers.
- Added support for Spatial Temporal Post-Processing (STP) upscaling solution.

#### Changes introduced in 2023.2

- Added HDRP path tracer support for Decals projectors. The path tracer does not support emission from decals.
- Added the ability to stream Probe Volume data from disk at runtime. You can enable or disable disk streaming for different quality levels.
- Made HDRP Shader Graph decals compatible with transparent objects. This means you can use decals created with Shader Graph to affect transparent objects to build procedural effects like rain drops, ripples, custom engravings, dirt effects on glass.
- Added a night sky with stars and celestial bodies to the HDRP physical sky.
- Added a Shader Graph output for the physically based sky and added controls to create a moon.
- Added visualization of async compute passes and their synchronization points to the Render Graph Viewer.
- Added beer shadow maps for volumetric clouds.
- Added a Volume Profile field to HD Render Pipeline Asset.
- Added a material type for thin objects with colored transmission.
- Added the option to disable clear coat on the material for Lit ShaderGraphs.
- Added the Global Pass API that you can use to inject custom passes in the render pipeline without any GameObjects in a scene.
- Added the volumetric fog fullscreen debug mode output for Arbitrary Output Variables (AOV).
- Added Adaptive Probe Volumes (APV) ability to stream data directly from the disk. This feature is only available on devices with compute shader compatibility.
- Added the ability to use the baking API to bake Adaptive Probe Volumes (APV) independently from lightmaps or reflection probes.

#### Changes introduced in 2023.1

- Light Layers and Decal Layers are now managed in similar ways in both HDRP and URP. In HDRP they now share the first 16 Rendering Layers, instead of using 8 separate bits each. Additionally, a new option in the HDRP Asset allows access to a full screen buffer that contains the Rendering Layers Masks of rendered Objects. HDRP can sample that buffer from the ShaderGraph through the HD Sample Buffer node, and use it to implement custom effects, like outlining objects on a specific rendering layer.
- All Ray Tracing HDRP features (raytraced shadows, reflections, AO, global illumination, path tracing, recursive rendering,…) are officially out of experimental in Unity 2023.1.0.
- Added a foam system to the HDRP Water System.
- Probe Volumes are out of experimental. Revamped the control interface to provide a better experience when you place Probe Volumes, light dynamic objects and some static objects, stream data from GPU memory, interpolate lighting data sets, and work with volumetric fog and particles.
- Added a third level of noise for volumetric clouds.
- Added Generic Rendering Layer mode support.
- Added High Quality Line Rendering which unlocks improved performance and image quality for line topology.
- Added the ability to compute the thickness of an object.

- Added volumetric material support for local volumetric fog volumes.
- Exposed Material Type in materials using the Lit Shader Graph.
- Improved stripping of unused features.
- **Specular color** on HDRP/Lit and HDRP/StackLit below 2% can be used to suppress specular lighting completely when “Specular Fade” is enabled.
- Improved the water rendering system in the following ways:
  - Added functionality to Water Mask so it dynamically removes water from inside a boat or in a cave in the middle of an island.
  - Modified the water deformer to dynamically deform water locally. For example, to deform water around a moving ship, deform waves near shores, or deform water in a vortex.
  - Added flow maps to create local currents, to manage surface waves that follow currents, and the water query API to allow objects to drift.
  - Added a water line to manage the transition for cameras that are half underwater.
  - Improved visual quality of water.
  - Improved the UX of the water system.
- Added an extra optional pass to compute thickness of transparent objects at runtime to get more accurate refraction and transparency rendering.
- Improved visual quality when using temporal anti-aliasing (TAA) with two new options to perform sharpening. The first option is a post-process pass that offers higher quality sharpening, control over the amount of sharpening, and an option to reduce possible ringing artifacts. The second option is to run Contrast Adaptive Sharpening from AMD FidelityFX.
- Specular light can now be completely faded when using a specular color workflow using the HDRP/Lit and HDRP/StackLit shaders by toggling a new option that can be found in the HDRP Global Settings under Miscellaneous/Specular Fade.
- Added Rendering Layers support to Adaptive Probe Volumes (APV) to address light leaking issues in interior/exterior scenarios.
- Added a new Leak Reduction Mode for Adaptive Probe Volume sampling called ‘Quality’, which ensures that no invalid probes are sampled.
- Implemented an anti-seam mechanism to smooth transitions between multiple subdivision levels in Adaptive Probe Volumes.

## Multiplayer

Unity 6.0 Multiplayer features are designed to simplify and accelerate multiplayer game development in a way that prepares you for future integration with Multiplayer Services and supports the growth of engaged player communities over time.

### Multiplayer Center Core

The new Multiplayer Center makes it easier to set up and develop multiplayer games. Prompts and workflows use parameters and requirements for your game to suggest relevant packages and services before generating dynamic templates you can use to start your project.

You no longer need to leave the Editor to set up a multiplayer game. Personalized interactive guidance, educational materials, and shortcuts make it easier to experiment and respond to feedback early and often.

### Multiplayer Widgets

New Multiplayer Widgets make it easier to integrate Multiplayer Services into your multiplayer game. You can access the widgets as a standalone package or from the new Multiplayer Center.

Included widgets for services such as Multiplay, Relay, Lobby, Vivox make it easier to find compatible, relevant integrations. For example, integrating the Relay service into the Editor makes it easier to create sessions and connect users earlier in the development process.

### Multiplayer Services

The newly released [Multiplayer Services package](https://docs.unity.com/ugs/en-us/manual/mps-sdk/manual/get-started) makes it easier to manage dependencies across multiplayer services. For example, you can:

- Quickly add multiplayer elements that integrate Unity Gaming Services into your game.
- Set up Lobby, Relay, Distributed Authority, Matchmaker and Multiplay Hosting. A new session system provides a simple shared cloud-side backing for a multiplayer game loop that groups players together and manages a shared session/player state.
- Create and manage peer-to-peer (P2P), Dedicated Game Server, and Distributed Authority hosted online sessions. Players can join sessions through matchmaking, a Join Code, or by browsing a list of active sessions.

To make configuration easier, sessions now integrate directly with Netcode for GameObjects, Netcode for Entities, and the Unity Transport package.

#### Changes introduced in Unity 6.0 Preview

- Added Distributed Authority mode in Netcode for GameObjects clients have distributed ownership of or authority over spawned Netcode objects during a game session. With Distributed Authority, the clients have the governed authority to spawn network objects which is announced to the cloud state service and conveys state updates to all connected clients. A highly optimized cloud state service maintains the overall state of a network session between clients.
- Added a new RPC attribute that can perform the functions of both Server and Client RPCs, as well as enabling client-to-client RPCs.
- Added many utility methods, which include `NetworkManager.OnConnectionEvent`, `-ServerIsHost`, `-InstantiateAndSpawn`, and more.

#### Changes introduced in Unity 2023.2

- Added the **Refresh In-Scene Prefab Instances** option in the Network Object component context menu. Use this property to update the `GlobalObjectIdHash` value for prefab instances in the scene that existed before they had a `NetworkObject` component. This property affects all scenes included in the build list.
- Added the `NetworkManager` methods `SetPeerMTU` and `GetPeerMTU` to give full control over Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) sizes. Use this for custom protocols in Netcode for GameObjects.
- Improved network prefab identification generation (for example, `GlobalObjectIdHash`) to fix issues where Unity assigned invalid values.
- Improved the serialization API and codegen pipelines in the following ways:
  - Added the `GenerateSerializationForTypeAttribute` method that you can apply to any class or method to ensure the specific type is included in the codegen serialization process.
  - Added the `GenerateSerializationForGenericParameterAttribute` method that you can use to include generic type(s) wrapped by a `NetworkVariable` type in the codegen process.
  - Exposed additional `NetworkVariableSerialization` methods to improve custom `NetworkVariable` creation without any boxing cost. You can use the `NetworkVariableBase.MarkNetworkBehaviourDirty` method to mark NetworkVariables as dirty.
- RPCs in generic `NetworkBehaviour` types can now serialize parameters of the class’s generic types.
- Improved support for 32-bit ARMv7 in Netcode.
- Added additional `NetworkManager` events `OnServerStarted`, `OnServerStopped`, `OnClientStarted`, and `OnClientStopped` to provide better notification of the `NetworkManager` initialization process.

- Enhancements to the list panel:
  - Added a **Packages - Asset Store** expander in the list panel of the **In Project** context, so you can view and manage Asset Store packages from the **In Project** view.
  - Relocated the search box and changed its behavior so it recalls your search terms on a per-context basis.
- Enhancements to the details panel:
  - Improved the flow for managing packages in the **My Assets** context by streamlining the action buttons in the details panel. The most common action appears as the default action in a menu button, with additional actions listed in the menu. Also added an **In Project** label to clearly indicate when an Asset Store package is already imported into your project and up-to-date.
  - Updated the label of the **Import** button when viewing an Asset Store package. After you download an updated Asset Store package, the main action button label is **Import update #.# to project**, so it’s clear that you need to import the update to your project.
  - Updated the behavior of the Documentation link for packages that you installed from a registry. You can now right-click the link and choose to **Open in browser** or **Open locally**.
  - Added a button to sign in with your Unity ID when you’re logged out and try to view the details of an Asset Store package.
